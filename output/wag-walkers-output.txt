          <h1>Request a Cover | Wag! Help Center</h1>
                    <h3>Request a Cover</h3>
                         <h4> In the event you’re unable to complete a service, you may request a cover through the Walker App. Requesting a cover makes the service available for another Pet Caregiver to accept. While we understand you may need a cover on a rare occasion, repeated use of covers may affect your Pet Parent Favorability. More importantly, it results in a poor experience for the Pet Parent and their pet.  
How do I cancel a service? 
 You can submit a cover from the Home Screen of the Walker App:  
 
 Tap "Booked" (the calendar icon) → 
 Tap the red bell → 
 Tap "Request a Cover" → 
 Tap "Yes" & select the service(s) for which you need to submit a cover. 
 
Does submitting a cover affect my ability to book services? 
 While there may be rare occasions where you need a cover, repeated use of this capability or calling Support to request a cover may affect your cancellation rating (which is part of your Pet Parent Favorability). More importantly, it results in a poor experience for the Pet Parent and their pet.  
What if the Pet Parent requests a cancellation? 
 If a Pet Parent needs to cancel a service, they need to do so in the "Schedule" tab of the Wag! App. Submitting a cover at the request of a Pet Parent can affect your cancellation rating (which is part of your Pet Parent Favorability). </h4>

                    <h3>Running Late?</h3>
                         <h4>What do I do if I'm running late? 
 If you are running late for a scheduled service, please communicate with the Pet Parent via in-app chat and update your ETA (iOS only). If you fail to do so, a cover may be created for the schedule and you will not receive a payout or a cancellation fee for the service.  
How do I update my ETA if I'm stuck in traffic or running behind? 
 If you're running late and you're using an iOS device, you can update your ETA for an active service by tapping the "ETA" button in the top right corner of the screen. </h4>

                         <h4>What do I do if a Pet Parent needs to update their schedule? 
 If a Pet Parent reaches out to you to request a schedule change including a change in time, an extension, an addition to dog count, or a cancellation, please redirect them to the Wag! App, where they can make changes to their schedule under the Upcoming Services tile. </h4>

                    <h3>Tips from Other Pet Caregivers</h3>
                         <h4>Service Animals 
 If you require a service animal, it's recommended to follow these steps:  
 
 Add the information about requiring a service animal to your public bio 
 Prior to the service, reach out to the pet parent and inform them of the need for the service animal 
 If the service animal assists you on the walk, please ask the pet parent if they have any safety issues with their own dogs that may put you or the animals in danger 
   
   If no, complete the service as normal 
   If yes, please submit a cover through the app  
    
 
Navigating The App 
 As an app-based platform, efficient navigation of the app can play a major role in a successful service. Pet Caregivers on the platform have found success in preparing to perform a service with Wag! by doing the following:  
 
 Completing their test walk 
 Familiarizing themselves with the app navigation and features 
 Reading the Terms of Services 
 Reading the Pet Caregivers section of the Wag! help center 
 
Keeping Keys Safe 
 A Pet Parent places a great deal of trust in Pet Caregivers to access their property and care for their dog(s). Pet Caregivers have shared the following tips for keeping a Pet Parent’s keys safe:  
 
 Put the key back in its original spot before heading out on the walk 
 Make sure the key is secure prior to ending the service 
 If for any reason you are unable to lock up, make sure to indicate this in the app upon completion of the service  
 Ensure the property is secured in the same way it was when you arrived 
 If keys are misplaced, contact the Pet Parent and Customer Service for assistance  
 
Security and Home Access 
 Staying safe and making thoughtful decisions are important to the wellbeing of Pet Caregivers, Pet Parents, and the dogs using Wag!. Pet Caregivers have found success in staying safe and making thoughtful decisions by doing the following:  
 
 Entering a Pet Parent's home through designated doors / entries 
 Avoiding unsafe situations 
 Avoiding entering or accessing areas of the home not necessary to completing a service 
 Remaining aware of their surroundings 
 
Picking Up After The Pup 
 Dog waste can spread disease and become a smelly nuisance. In addition, many jurisdictions will issue a citation for dog waste that has not been picked up. Pet Caregivers have shared the following suggestions:  
 
 Before leaving on the walk, be sure you have something handy to pick up after the dog(s) 
 Clean up the dog’s waste while on the walk 
 It is a good idea to keep a few bags on hand at all times 
 If a citation is issued, work respectfully with the local officials while communicating with the Pet Parent and Wag! customer service

                    <h3>General Information</h3>
                         <h4> Wag! makes safety a priority for all dogs, Pet Caregivers, Pet Parents and others on the Platform. Vaccinations help prevent dog diseases, aid in avoiding costly treatments for animal illnesses and even prevent the spread of certain diseases to humans. Wag! maintains a strict Vaccination Policy prohibiting unvaccinated dogs on the Platform. This means that in order to be eligible to receive an in-person Service (Walk, Drop-In, Overnight Care, or Training), each dog must have the following up-to-date shots and vaccines: DA2PPV, Bordetella, and Rabies.  Your veterinarian may also recommend others specifically relevant to your dog or location. In addition, for areas that have a high incidence, Wag! also recommends the canine influenza vaccination. </h4>

          <h1>Services | Wag! Help Center</h1>
               <h2>Walks</h2>
                    <h3>One-Time Walks</h3>
                         <h4>What are One-Time Walks? 
 One-time walks are a scheduled, one-time commitment of either 20, 30, or 60 minutes. These walks are a great option for Pet Caregivers who need a flexible schedule.  
Can Pet Parents book several One-Time Walks at once? 
 Yes! It’s important to note that Pet Parents may request more than one “one-time” walk per week. In this instance, you’ll see which days the Pet Parent has requested their dog to be walked, with the “One-Time” label underneath the time and walk length. This means these walks are only for the upcoming week, not a request for a recurring schedule.  
Where do I see the walk type in the app? 
 The walk type will be noted below the requested time and walk length. The service will be listed as a one-time walk, on-demand walk, or recurring walk.  
 To view the walks available in your area, click here. </h4>

                    <h3>Recurring</h3>
                         <h4>What is a Recurring Service? 
 Recurring services repeat each week on the same day(s) and time(s). These walks typically require a commitment of 3+ months and allow Pet Caregivers to keep a consistent, set schedule.  
What if I'm unavailable for one of the services in a Recurring Schedule? 
 In the event you’re unavailable for a service in your recurring schedule, you can request a cover.  Pet Caregivers recommend submitting a request two weeks in advance to give ample time to find a cover and help ensure the Pet Parent is receiving the quality of service he or she expects. </h4>

                    <h3>On-Demand</h3>
                         <h4>What is an On-Demand Walk? 
 On-Demand Walks, shown in the Walker App as "ASAP," are walks that have not been scheduled in advanced by the Pet Parent. Instead, the Pet Parent requests the walk to occur as soon as possible.  
How do I know if a walk is On-Demand? 
 On-Demand Walks will appear in the Walker App as "ASAP" and will typically reflect a start time within the next 30-minutes.  
What if the start time for an ASAP or On-Demand Walk has passed? 
 If you see an On-Demand Walk in the Available Walks Feed with a start time that has already passed, the Pet Parent has been waiting longer than usual for a Pet Caregiver to opt-in. If you're available, feel free to opt-in to the service!  
I opted in to an On-Demand Walk but I wasn't approved, and the Walk is still in my Feed. What do I do? 
 The Walk was already accepted by another Pet Caregiver. It will disappear from your Feed shortly. </h4>

               <h2>Overnight Care</h2>
                    <h3>Sitting</h3>
                         <h4>What is a Sitting? 
 A Sitting is Overnight Care that takes place at the Pet Parent's Home. During the day, Pet Caregivers will keep the pet company and take care of them, including regular feeding & potty breaks, and of course plenty of snuggles! It's best practice to communicate with the Pet Parent as you prepare for a Sitting to ensure all their needs and expectations are met.   
Am I able to leave during a Sitting? 
 Pet Caregivers can come and go during the day, but they are encouraged to be with the pet(s) as much as possible and not leave for more than a few hours at a time.  
Can I book other services while I have an active Sitting? 
 While Pet Caregivers can only have one active Overnight Care appointment at a time, they are still able to schedule Walks and Drop-Ins. It's best for Pet Caregivers to keep in mind the Pet Parent's expectations for the sitting or boarding while performing other services on the platform. It's best practice to communicate with the Pet Parent as you prepare for a Boarding to ensure all their needs and expectations are met. </h4>

                    <h3>Preparing For Transportation</h3>
                         <h4>Do I need to pick up the pet? 
 If a Pet Parent requires you to pick up their pet for a Boarding appointment, it will be listed in the details of the service, which you'll see before opting-in.  
How do I transport a pet? 
 If you’ve booked a Boarding with a transportation component, it’s important to know how to safely and securely transport the dog from the Pet Parent’s home to yours, and back!  
 It’s the Pet Parent’s responsibility to provide adequate equipment for the transportation of their pup.  This can include a dog seat belt or harness and/or crate. Crates are a good option to help ensure the pup’s safety when traveling, especially when in a car.  If you use a crate, make sure that the crate is the correct size for the dog being transported and that the crate is securely anchored to the vehicle. This can be done in a variety of ways, so be sure you choose the correct option for the dog, and crate being used.

                    <h3>Boarding</h3>
                         <h4>What is a Boarding? 
 A Boarding is Overnight Care that takes place at the Pet Caregiver's home. Pet Caregivers will keep the pet company and take care of them, including regular feeding & potty breaks, and of course plenty of snuggles! It's best practice to communicate with the Pet Parent as you prepare for a Boarding to ensure all their needs and expectations are met.   
Do I need to pick up and drop off the pets? 
 Pet Parents can request their pets to be picked up and dropped for an additional fee. Pet Caregivers will receive an additional payment for pick-up and drop-off as well.  
Am I able to leave during a Boarding? 
 Pet Caregivers can come and go during the day, but they are encouraged to be with the pet(s) as much as possible and not leave for more than a few hours at a time.  
Can I book other services while I have an active Boarding? 
 While Pet Caregivers can only have one active Overnight Care appointment at a time, they are still able to schedule Walks and Drop-Ins.

               <h2>Training</h2>
                    <h3>Digital Training</h3>
                         <h4>What is Digital Training? 
 Digital Training is a 30-minute training service that occurs virtually, via video chat.  
What happens during a Digital Training session? 
 The sky's the limit! What happens and what is covered during a Digital Training session is up to you and the Pet Parent. Some Pet Caregivers find it useful to coordinate goals with the Pet Parent prior to the scheduled service.  
When can a Training be booked? 
 Training sessions are available between 8 AM and 8:30 PM, 7 days a week.  
How many dogs are included in a Training session? 
 Up to three pets can be included, however, Training sessions are intended for one pet.  
Can Pet Parents book urgent or on-demand Training sessions? 
 No, all Training sessions must be scheduled in advance.  
How do I access the Digital Training session? 
 You will access your Digital Training through the Wag! App via a video chat room.   
Do I need to allow permissions on my device? 
 Yes, you  will need to allow permissions for the following:  
 
 Camera 
 Microphone 
 External Storage 
 
What if I log into the Digital Training later than the scheduled time? -or- What if the Pet Parent is late? 
 We highly recommend communicating with the Pet Parent through the app prior to your Digital Training session to coordinate an exact time you are both available to start. Once you start the video chat, the time clock cannot be paused or reset.   
When does the 30 minutes start? 
 The clock starts as soon as the Trainer enters the video chat. A timer will be displayed on screen during the training session to help keep track of time.   
What happens if the Digital Training goes over the 30 minute limit? 
 The video chat session will automatically disconnect at the 35 minute mark.  
What if I or the Pet Parent have technical issues and get disconnected during the session? 
 Once the timer starts on the session, it cannot be reset or paused. You may rejoin the video chat session if you are disconnected and pick up where you left off. If you or the Pet Parent have a prolonged disconnect that severely impacts the Digital Training session, please contact Customer Service via the "Help" tab in the app.   
Can Pet Parents leave a tip? 
 Absolutely! Once the Digital Training session has ended the Pet Parent will be given the opportunity to leave a tip through the Wag! App.  
Do I need to leave a report card? 
 Yes; you will leave you a report card for the Pet Parent in which you may want to include follow up notes, reminders, tips, or homework.  
Can a Pet Parent rebook me directly for additional Training sessions? 
 Yes; after your initial session, Pet Parents are able to book with you directly from the Wag! App. </h4>

                    <h3>In-Home Training</h3>
                         <h4>What is In-home Training? 
 In-home Training is a 60-minute training service that occurs in-person, at the Pet Parent's home.  
When can a Training be booked? 
 Training sessions are available between 8 AM and 8:30 PM, 7 days a week.  
Can Pet Parents book urgent or on-demand Training sessions? 
 No, all Training sessions must be scheduled in advance.  
How many dogs are included in a Training session? 
 Up to three pets can be included, however, Training sessions are intended for one pet.  
Are Pet Parents expected to participate in Training sessions? 
 Training sessions are meant to be hands-on for Pet Parents, which provides an opportunity for them to learn how to correct or encourage behaviors with basic obedience techniques. This allows trainers to see the pets' normal routines and behaviors in a familiar setting and with familiar people.   
How should I start a Training session? 
 Because each lesson is unique, Pet Caregivers are encouraged to begin each session with an assessment of the Pet Parent’s needs and desired skills; these are then used to create an individualized plan for improvement using appropriate training methods.  
Should I send anything to the Pet Parent before a Training session? 
 Some Pet Caregivers find it valuable to send Pet Parents materials to review leading up to their Training sessions. Sending videos and photos both during and after the session can also help to mark the progress of both the pet and Pet Parent.  
Can a Pet Parent rebook me directly for additional Training sessions? 
 Yes; after your initial session, Pet Parents are able to book with you directly from the Wag! App.  
  
 NOTE: In-person Training sessions are only available in select markets. </h4>

                    <h3>Drop-Ins</h3>
                         <h4>What is a Drop-In? 
 Drop-Ins are 20-minute-long services booked by Pet Parents who are looking for a Pet Caregiver to quickly check-in on their pet(s).  
What do I do during a Drop-In? 
 The Wag! and Walker Apps include Notes features for Pet Parents to include their expectations of the Drop-In prior to the Pet Caregiver accepting the service. As with any service, it's important to communicate with the Pet Parent if their expectations are unclear. You can communicate with the Pet Parent directly via the "Messages" tab in the Walker App.  
How long is a Drop-In? 
 Drop-Ins last 20 minutes.   
What if the Pet Parent would like me to stay longer than 20 minutes? 
 In the event a Pet Parent would like the Pet Caregiver to stay longer than 20 minutes, it is recommended the Pet Parent books a 30- or 60-minute Walk in the app, and leaves explicit instructions for the Pet Caregiver around the type of service they’d like their pup to receive. You can communicate with the Pet Parent directly via the "Messages" tab in the Walker App. </h4>

                    <h3>Notification FAQ</h3>
                         <h4>What notifications should I expect to receive from Wag!? 
 Wag! sends push notifications for services available near you, when you’ve received a tip, and promotions from the Marketing Team. SMS notifications are sent when you’ve booked a service, when you’re late for a service, and as confirmation that a cover has been submitted.   
How do available service notifications work?  
 When a schedule is requested by a Pet Parent, the service enters the feed and Wag! sends an initial batch of notifications to Pet Caregivers who are preferred for the service. After a couple minutes, if the schedule is still unfilled, a second batch of notifications is sent to the Pet Caregivers who are closest to the service location (based on the PCG’s Available Service Filter location settings). Next, if the service is still unfilled, an additional batch of notifications is sent to Pet Caregivers in the area, selected based on distance from service. This process continues until the service is filled.  
Why are my notifications delayed? 
 The Wag! system sends out notifications in real time. However, due to circumstances beyond our control such as carrier issues and signal strength there may be times notifications are delayed in getting to you. Make sure you have good signal strength. Delays in notifications may also occur on a device that is connected to WiFi.   
Why am I not receiving push notifications? 
 
 You are logged in to more than one device (Note: The most recently logged into device will receive the notifications.) Log out, then back in on the device you’d like to receive notifications on to reset your device token. 
 There is low or no service availability in your area. This typically means you will also not see any services in your available service feed, either.  
 Your Walker App notification settings are set to “off.” Update your notification settings on the Available Service Filters screen.  
 Your phone's settings for push notifications are set to “off” or are disabled for the Wag! Walker app. Allow notifications from Wag! Walker in your device settings.  
 
Why am I not receiving text notifications?  
 As of January 2020, Wag! has discontinued SMS notifications for available walks and will be exclusively sending push notifications for these alerts. A few other reasons you could no longer be receiving text notifications include:   
 
 Your notification settings are set to “off.”  
 You blocked text notifications. Text the word "START" to 240-06 re-enable text messages from Wag!. 
 
How do I update my notification settings?  
 You can update what services you’d like to receive notifications about in your Available Service Filters, located in the top right corner of the Home screen. From here, you can turn off notifications completely, set your location and the distance from which you’d like to be notified of a service, adjust start times, and select service types.   
How do I update or add an address? 
 
 Tap on the Available Service Filters icon in the top right corner of the Home screen → 
 Tap “Services Near” →

 Tap "Save." To edit an address, tap the green pencil icon next to the location you wish to edit (Android) / tap “Edit” under the address (iOS). 
 
How do I turn off push notifications?

 Tap “Save” 
 
How do I turn off text notifications? 
 To opt-out of text message notifications from Wag!, text “STOP” to 240-06. If you’d like to turn text notifications back on, text “START” to 240-06.  
Why don’t I see any available services? 
 There may not be any services available in your area, or your available service filters may be too narrow. Try expanding your filters, and refreshing the service feed by pulling down on the screen then releasing.  
Why am I not being accepted for services? 
 If you tap a push notification for an available service and the walk is not featured in your Available Service Feed or you were able to opt-in and were not approved, the service was unfortunately taken by another Pet Caregiver. </h4>

                    <h3>Average Star Rating</h3>
                         <h4> What is a Pet Caregiver star rating?   
 Each Pet Caregiver earns an average star rating based on reviews provided by Pet Parents. Your average star rating is the sum of all the ratings you’ve received divided by your total number of ratings.   
 You can view your star rating at any time by navigating to your profile. The number on the left is your average star rating. In parentheses, you'll see your number of reviews.  
   
 Note: Your star rating is not the same as your Pet Parent Favorability, however your star rating is one factor that goes into determining your overall Pet Parent Favorability.  </h4>

                    <h3>Pet Parent Favorability</h3>
                         <h4>What is Pet Parent Favorability? 
 A Pet Caregiver’s Pet Parent Favorability is simply how valuable the Pet Caregiver’s services are to a Pet Parent. A number of factors are applied to determine a Pet Caregiver’s Pet Parent Favorability, all of which can be found within the Wag! Community Guidelines.  
For what is Pet Parent Favorability used? 
 Pet Parent Favorability is used to find the perfect Pet Caregiver for each pet care task scheduled using the Wag! platform.   
How do I increase my Pet Parent Favorability? 
 Pet Parents expect services to be completed with care and attention to detail. Your reliability (including timeliness and commitment) also affects the Pet Parent’s experience and therefore your Pet Parent Favorability. The strength of your profile is another factor; the more complete and thorough your profile is, the more valuable your profile will be to Pet Parents looking to book pet care services.   
 The Wag! Community Guidelines are the framework for Pet Parent Favorability and are in place to help facilitate a community-wide understanding of expectations and standards of conduct while using Wag!. Ultimately, following and exemplifying Wag!’s Community Guidelines makes your services more valuable to the Pet Parent’s using Wag!. For additional information as to how Pet Parent Favorability is determined, you may revisit the Wag! Community Guidelines. </h4>

                    <h3>Badges</h3>
                         <h4>What are badges?

                    <h3>Wag! Pet Caregiver Deactivation Policy</h3>
                         <h4> Pet Caregivers who have an average star rating below 4.75 will be subject to deactivation. Star rating and other factors are detailed in the Pet Care Provider Platform Use Agreement signed by each Pet Caregiver. Pet Caregivers who violate the agreement or Wag!’s Community Guidelines may be subject to deactivation. The Deactivation Policy also states that Pet Caregiver accounts may be subject to suspension during the time Wag! takes to investigate a possible violation.  
Can I appeal a deactivation if my rating falls below 4.75? 
 No. Deactivations due to low star rating are not eligible for appeal.  
Why does Wag! have a deactivation policy? 
 Wag! is dedicated to creating and maintaining a safe community for the Pet Caregivers and Pet Parents on the platform. To help ensure a safe experience for everyone, we rely on each community member to abide by the Wag! Community Guidelines as well as our Pet Care Provider Platform User Agreement. The five star rating system is one of the ways Wag! leverages community feedback to help create and maintain a safe and reliable community.  
How can I check my standing to ensure I’m not subject to deactivation? 
 You can see your star rating in the “My Profile” section of the Wag! application. Pet caregivers will be notified via email if they are at risk for deactivation due to low star rating. Once a Pet Caregiver receives this notice, they will have 30 days to improve. They will also receive a second update email after 14 days informing them of their progress.  
What if I did not receive a warning email? 
 Please check your spam folders and ensure that the email address associated with your Wag! account is still active.  
What if I am not available to do any walks in the 30-day warning period? Can I request an extension? 
 Wag! gives all Pet Caregivers 30 days to meet community standards. Pet Caregivers will not be granted an extension if they are unable to or choose not to participate in services with Wag!.  
How many times can my star rating drop below 4.75? 
 None. Once a Pet Caregiver's star rating falls below 4.75, they are subject to deactivation.  
If I'm deactivated, will I still be paid for past completed walks? 
 Yes. Any successfully completed services will be paid out, regardless of whether the Pet Care Provider is subject to deactivation or has been deactivated.  
If I'm deactivated, can I reapply? 
 No. Once a Pet Caregiver is deactivated for falling below the set criteria or is deactivated for a Community Guidelines violation, they will not not be allowed to re-apply as a Pet Caregiver on the Wag! platform.  
Are Pet Parents subject to these same standards? 
 This Deactivation Policy is based on criteria specific to Pet Caregivers. Pet Parents can be deactivated from the Wag! platform if they violate Wag!’s Terms of Service, which includes the Wag! Community Guidelines.  
What if I'm a new Pet Caregiver? 
 Pet Caregivers must complete at least ten services on the Wag! platform to be subject to this policy. </h4>

                    <h3>After a Boarding/Sitting</h3>
                         <h4> Do I need to complete a report card for Boardings and Sittings?  
 Report cards are an important part of the Wag! experience for Pet Parents! After the Boarding or Sitting is complete, you’ll be prompted to fill out a final report card for the service. Pet Parents love to get notes about their dog’s experience!  
What's included in a Boarding and Sitting report card? 
 
 A photo of the dog you took during the service 
 Notes written for the Pet Parent about the service 
 Indication whether the pup regularly peed & pooed 
 Confirmation that you locked the home and returned the key (if applicable) 
 
How do I edit/change my report card? 
 Once a report card has been submitted, it cannot be changed. </h4>

               <h2>Payments/Finance</h2>
                    <h3>Payments & Stripe Connect</h3>
                         <h4>How much do I get paid? 
 The payment for each service is listed under the service in the Available Walks Feed. You receive the posted amount plus 100% of any tips you receive from Pet Parents.  
When do I get paid? 
 Payments are processed every Wednesday and paid out every Friday. The pay cycle is Tuesday through Monday, so for all walks completed on or after Tuesday, the payment will appear in the following pay cycle. If you'd like to receive a payment sooner (and you're eligible), you can utilize the Instant Pay feature via the "Earnings" tab in the Walker App.  
How do tips work? 
 Pet Caregivers receive 100% of any tips they receive from Pet Parents. Pre-set tips can be adjusted after completion of the service based on the satisfaction of the Pet Parent. Please note that setting pre-set tips is a temporary function due to the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. Tips are not guaranteed.  
What is Stripe Connect? 
 Stripe Connect is the platform that allows Pet Caregivers to be paid for the services they offer on Wag!.  
How do I set up Stripe Connect? 
 When you log in to the Wag! App for the first time, you will be prompted to set up a new Stripe Connect account. To set up your Stripe account:  
 
 After your application is approved, you’ll receive an email from Wag! that will prompt you to download the Pet Caregiver app. Tap on the link to download the app → 
 Create a password → 
 Download and Install the Wag! Pet Caregiver app → 
 Tap on the Wag! Pet Caregiver app icon to open it → 
   
   If you are on iOS, you’ll need to trust the app first. Go to iOS Settings > General > Device Management > Tap "WAG LABS INC." in the Enterprise App section > Tap "Trust" > Tap "Confirm." 
    
 Log in. You’ll see a prompt to set up a new Stripe Connect account → 
 Confirm that your email address and phone number are correct → 
 Verify your phone number → 
 Fill out your banking information, using the info for the account through which you wish to receive payments. 
 
Troubleshooting Stripe 
 If you are having trouble adding your info to Stripe in the Pet Caregiver App, you can access your Stripe account directly by navigating to one of the following links on a web browser:   
 
 New Accounts (create a new Stripe Connect account) 
 Existing Accounts (edit your Stripe Connect account / verify your information) 
 
How do pay periods work? 
 A pay period starts on a Tuesday and ends the following Monday. Earnings accrued during that pay period will be paid out to your bank account on the following Friday (4 days after the pay period ends). You may also be eligible for Instant Pay!  
How do I change my banking information in Stripe Connect? 
 
 In the Walker App, go to the "Earnings" screen → 
 Tap the three dots in the upper right corner → 
 Tap "Sign into Stripe" → 
 You’ll then be taken directly to your stripe.com dashboard, where you can edit your personal and banking information.  
 
How can I see a list of all the payments to my bank account? 
 In the Pet Caregiver app, go to the "Earnings" screen, tap the three dots in the upper right corner, then tap "Sign into Stripe." You’ll then be taken directly to your stripe.com dashboard, where you can view your payment history.  
I'm not able to log in to Stripe or I'm getting a Stripe error message; what should I do? 
 Please contact the Stripe support team here.  
Why does my Stripe Connect Dashboard read $0 balance even though the Walker App says I have a positive balance? 
 The "Earnings" screen in the Walker App always reflects the most recent and updated information. The Stripe Connect Dashboard will read $0 balance until Wednesday, right after the pay period closes. After the payment has reached your bank account, the Dashboard will reset back to $0. If at any point in the pay period you'd like to check the amount of your next payment, please visit the "Earnings" screen in the Walker App. </h4>

                         <h4>Am I eligible to receive a 1099?

What is 1099 e-Delivery? 
 1099 e-Delivery allows you to receive your 1099 electronically via a link sent to your email. You will be required to complete the e-Delivery consent before you can receive a 1099 electronically. You will not receive a copy by mail if you opt in to e-Delivery.  
Why do I have to consent to receive my 1099 electronically? 
 By default, tax documents are physically mailed. If you would like to receive your 1099 electronically instead, your consent is required.  
Do I have to utilize e-Delivery to receive my 1099? 
 No. e-Delivery of your tax documents is optional. If you do not opt-in for e-Delivery, your 1099 will be mailed to you.  
How do I sign up for e-Delivery? 
 Eligible Pet Caregivers will receive an email regarding e-Delivery consent. Follow the link in the email and you will be taken to a page where you may opt in or opt out of e-Delivery. If you opt out of e-Delivery, your 1099 will be physically mailed.

I signed up for e-Delivery but changed my mind; what do I do? 
 If you opted in to receive your 1099 electronically, but would now like it to be mailed to your physical address, please email woofsupport@wagwalking.com with the subject line “Revoke 1099 e-Delivery Consent.”  
Can I request a 1099 be sent if I made less than $600?

                    <h3>Stripe Connect Troubleshooting</h3>

 Access an account (edit your existing Stripe Connect account / verify your information)

 You will need to sign in with your Wag! Walker credentials to create and/or access your Stripe Connect account. If you're still experiencing issues, visit Stripe's Help Center, or contact them directly.  
 * Note, you cannot sign into Stripe directly with your Wag! credentials, so you will either need to access Stripe via the app or from the link above. </h4>

                    <h3>Instant Pay</h3>
                         <h4>What is Instant Pay? How quickly can I get my payment? 
 Instant Pay allows eligible Pet Caregivers to instantly send money they’ve earned using the Wag! platform to an eligible debit card. A payment initiated with Instant Pay typically appears in the associated account within 30 minutes, but may take longer depending on your bank’s processing time. A 3% fee is deducted from each Instant Payment.  
 Note: Payments are reviewed, which may result in delays or funds being frozen or removed from your account. The standard weekly payment is still available for no fee.   
Am I required to use Instant Pay? 
 No. If you choose not to initiate Instant Pay, you will receive standard weekly payments, which are processed every Tuesday and paid out every Friday.  
How do I sign up for Instant Pay? 
 You do not need to sign up for Instant Pay; you will, however, need to add a debit card to your Stripe account to use Instant Pay.   
 Note: Adding a debit card to your Stripe account will default Stripe Instant Pay AND weekly payments to that debit card. To have your weekly payouts sent to your bank account, you need to have only ONE debit card and ONE bank account set up in Stripe. Pre-paid debit cards are not supported at this time.   
Is there a fee for Instant Pay? 
 The Instant Pay fee is 3% of the eligible payment amount, with a minimum fee of $1.99 and a minimum total payout of more than $1 (your "total payout" is the amount earned minus the Instant Pay fee). You will be able to view your “Total Payment” (the amount of money eligible for Instant Pay minus the fee) before requesting to initiate Instant Pay.   
 Note: Payments are reviewed, which may result in delays or funds being frozen or removed from your account. Your standard weekly payment is still available for no fee.   
Am I eligible to use Instant Pay? 
 To be eligible for Instant Pay on the Wag! platform, Pet Caregivers must (1) have been activated on the Wag! platform at least 30 days prior to the payment initiation, (2) completed at least 10 services via the Wag! platform, and (3) have successfully received at least one standard weekly payment through Stripe. Additionally, Pet Caregivers must be in good standing on the Wag! platform (not suspended or deactivated). Instant Pay requests can be initiated for amounts greater than the minimum fee amount ($1.99) to an eligible debit card on the Pet Caregiver's Stripe account.  
I didn’t see my payment immediately, what should I do? 
 When you successfully initiate an Instant Pay transaction, the status “Processing” will be displayed next to the Instant Pay symbol in the "Payments" screen on your app. When the transaction is successful, the status will be updated to “Completed.” If it has not been updated to “Completed” within 30 minutes, please be patient, as bank processing times may vary. If the transaction is marked as “Completed,” but you do not see the money appear in your account, please contact your bank.  
 When contacting your bank about a payment sent to your debit card, please note that money will appear as an original credit transaction (OCT), not an ACH or direct deposit.  
 Note: Payments are reviewed, which may result in delays or funds being frozen or removed from your account.  
When can I initiate instant pay? 
 Instant payments can be initiated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  
Why do standard weekly payments arrive slower than Instant Payments? 
 Standard weekly payments are processed using ACH bank processing, which typically takes 1-3 business days to appear in your account. Instant Pay is processed using a debit card, which allows the money to appear in your account more quickly.  
 Note: Payments are reviewed, which may result in delays or funds being frozen or removed from your account.  
How do I know if my debit card is eligible for Instant Pay? 
 Most debit cards from major banks are supported, and more bank debit cards are being added over time. Please contact Stripe if you have a question about whether your debit card is supported.  
Why is the eligible Instant Pay amount different from the displayed standard weekly amount? 
 A pay period starts on a Tuesday and ends the following Monday. Earnings accrued during that pay period will be transferred to your bank account on the following Friday (4 days after the pay period ends). Instant Pay can include funds outside of a standard pay period. You will be able to keep track of what services are included in a payment (whether a standard weekly payment or an Instant Payment) via the "Past Payments" screen in the Walker App. </h4>

                    <h3>Cancellation Fees</h3>
                         <h4>Will I receive a cancellation fee? 
 
 You will only receive a cancellation fee for a cancelled Walk or Drop-In if the Pet Parent cancels the service less than 1 hour before the scheduled Start Time and you have already hit “On My Way.” 
 You will only receive a cancellation fee for Overnight Care (Sitting or Boarding) or In-Home Training if the Pet Parent cancels less than 24 hours before the scheduled Start Time. 
 There are currently no cancellation fees issued for Digital Training Services.

                    <h3>Payment Discrepancies</h3>

 The pay cycle is Tuesday through Monday and payments are issued on Friday. For all walks completed on or after Tuesday, payment will appear in the following pay cycle.  
 What do I do if I'm missing a payment or a tip?  
 If there are any issues with your payments, please submit a Payment Discrepancy form. If you do not know the Walk ID, enter "0."

                    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                         <h4>What are Recommendations? 
 Recommendations are written statements from Pet Parents (friends, family, previous clients, etc.) that appear on your public Walker Profile. The more Recommendations you earn, the higher your Walker Score will be!  
How do I request Recommendations? 
 From the Main Menu of the Walker App, select the “Recommendations” Tab, or from "My Profile," scroll down to the “Recommendations” tab. From here, you can send an in-app message to previous Wag! clients or a text message to your contacts asking for their Recommendation. Be sure the Pet Parent is using their mobile device and the most up to date version of the Wag! App.  
    
How does a Recommendation affect my Pet Parent Favorability? 
 Every Recommendation you receive positively affects your Pet Parent Favorability. The more Recommendations you have, the higher your Favorability will be. The number of Recommendations you receive will also be reflected on your public profile for Pet Parents to see.  
How many Recommendations can I have? How many can I request? 
 You can request as many Recommendations as you’d like. There is also no limit to the amount of Recommendations you have on your profile.  
Are my Recommenders required to create a Wag! account? 
 Yes; an account is required to verify the person's identity and prevent fraudulent Recommendations. </h4>

You'll also receive a $20 Referral Award once the Pet Parent has completed their first fully paid service!

 You can create an account as an individual or as a “Neighbor for hire”. Nextdoor has restrictions on promoting your business with an individual account, so if you choose to join as an individual, make sure to follow their promotion rules listed here.   
 If you choose to create an account as a “Neighbor for hire”, neighbors will be able to easily find you when they search for pet caregiver services. They can also recommend you, which will allow other members to find your Business page in the Nextdoor Businesses section. Information about what you can and cannot post from your Business page can be found here.

Google Ads 
 While Google My Business is an accessible platform that allows users to list their business on Maps and Google Search, Google Ads is a paid advertising platform that can attract more visitors and new clients to their Google My Business website or public Wag! profile.   
 Google Ads can display your ad when people search online for services like dog walking, sitting and boarding. Generally you will only pay when users engage with your ad.   
 Information about advertising with Google can be found here.

                    <h3>Pet Caregiver Profile FAQ</h3>
                         <h4>What does it mean for my profile to be “public”? 
 With the newest update to Pet Caregiver profiles, you have the ability to copy the link to your profile and share it online or with family and friends! Anyone with your profile link will be able to view your profile online even if they aren’t currently on the Wag! platform.   
I don’t want my profile to be public. How do I make it private?  
 You can make your profile “private” at any time. Open your walker app and navigate to “settings”, then toggle the “public profile” setting to “off”. Keep in mind that if your profile is private, Pet Parents will not be able to book you directly through your profile for a referral bonus, and you won’t have the ability to share your profile online.   
What is a catchphrase? 
 Your personal catchphrase is an option for you to briefly introduce who you are as a Pet Caregiver and adds a personal touch to your profile. It’s one of the first things Pet Parents will see when viewing your profile. Catchphrases have a 50 character minimum.   
Why were my profile edits rejected? 
 Our automatic filters have detected one of the following types of content that either include profanity or your personal information:   
 
 Profane language 
 Email address 
 Phone number 
 Website  
 Social media reference 
 
 If you think your profile edits were rejected in error, please contact customer success. Please adhere to our community guidelines (https://wagwalking.com/community-guidelines/).  
Why is my catchphrase/bio “pending”? 
 If your catchphrase/bio is marked as “pending”, our automatic filters may have detected potential profanity or personal information such as your phone number or email address. If you think there is an error, please contact customer success. Please adhere to our community guidelines (https://wagwalking.com/community-guidelines/).  
I’m an Android user and I am not able to update my profile. What should I do? 
 If you are getting an error when updating your profile, it may be due to a system font conflict.   
 To update the font:  
 
 Navigate to your phone's Settings → 
 Tap "Display" → 
 Tap "Font Size and Style" → 
 Adjust font size to "default" (third dot from the left) 
 
 Once complete, try updating your profile again.  
I referred a pet parent through my profile. Why didn’t I receive a referral bonus? 
 In order to receive a referral bonus, the Pet Parent must sign up through your profile and complete their first paid walk.   
 If they have completed a paid walk and you still haven’t received the bonus, please reach out to our customer success team for support.  
A Pet Parent booked me through my profile. Why did they match with a different walker? 
 When a Pet Parent books you through your profile, you will be added to their preferred walker list. This gives you, and other preferred walkers for that Pet Parent, first priority for services where the pet parent specifies “try preferred” as their walker preference.  
 The most likely reason you did not match with the Pet Parent is another pet caregiver requested for the walk before you.   
How can I promote my profile online?  
 If you’d like to promote your profile online, you can copy your profile link from within the walker app. Click “promote”, then “copy link to my profile”. You can post your link online, or you can send it directly to friends via SMS, email, and more! Click here for more info.

                    <h3>Available Service Filters</h3>
                         <h4>What notifications should I expect to receive from Wag!? 
 Wag! sends push notifications for services available near you, when you’ve received a tip, and promotions from the Marketing Team. SMS notifications are sent when you’ve booked a service, when you’re late for a service, and as confirmation that a cover has been submitted.   
How do available service notifications work?  
 When a schedule is requested by a Pet Parent, the service enters the feed and Wag! sends an initial batch of notifications to Pet Caregivers who are preferred for the service. After a couple minutes, if the schedule is still unfilled, a second batch of notifications is sent to the Pet Caregivers who are closest to the service location (based on the PCG’s Available Service Filter location settings). Next, if the service is still unfilled, an additional batch of notifications is sent to Pet Caregivers in the area, selected based on distance from service. This process continues until the service is filled.  
Why are my notifications delayed? 
 The Wag! system sends out notifications in real time. However, due to circumstances beyond our control such as carrier issues and signal strength there may be times notifications are delayed in getting to you. Make sure you have good signal strength. Delays in notifications may also occur on a device that is connected to WiFi.   
Why am I not receiving push notifications? 
 
 You are logged in to more than one device (Note: The most recently logged into device will receive the notifications.) Log out, then back in on the device you’d like to receive notifications on to reset your device token. 
 There is low or no service availability in your area. This typically means you will also not see any services in your available service feed, either.  
 Your Walker App notification settings are set to “off.” Update your notification settings on the Available Service Filters screen.  
 Your phone's settings for push notifications are set to “off” or are disabled for the Wag! Walker app. Allow notifications from Wag! Walker in your device settings.  
 
Why am I not receiving text notifications?  
 As of January 2020, Wag! has discontinued SMS notifications for available walks and will be exclusively sending push notifications for these alerts. A few other reasons you could no longer be receiving text notifications include:

Why am I not being accepted for services? 
 If you tap a push notification for an available service and the walk is not featured in your Available Service Feed or you were able to opt-in and were not approved, the service was unfortunately taken by another Pet Caregiver. </h4>

               <h2>COVID-19</h2>
          <h1>Safety Center | Wag! Help Center</h1>
                    <h3>Info on COVID-19</h3>
                         <h4> We know the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") is on many of our minds. As we all continue to monitor the situation very closely, we wanted to share that Pet Caregivers continue to be available for walking, sitting and boarding on the Wag! platform. The health and safety for Pet Caregivers, Pet Parents and their dogs are and always will be our highest priority. In situations such as this, we understand that we need to evolve the Wag! platform to help do our part to best serve you and the community as safely as possible.   
 Below you’ll find information on recent platform changes, including Socially Distanced Services, dedicated COVID-19 Tip Function, and our COVID-19 Resource Center and FAQs. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as they become available.  
  
 Socially Distanced Services  
 Pet Parents may update “How to get in” to request a service as a socially distanced service and to provide specific instructions to help limit physical interactions. Here is an example of simple measures you can take when performing socially distanced services:  
 
 Requesting a “socially distanced service” - When requesting a walk through the Wag! platform, Pet Parents have the option to update the "How to get in" section with the socially distanced service request and any relevant instructions to help limit interaction. For example: "Socially Distanced Service - I’ll have Fido ready with a harness and leash on. Please knock or message me in-app when you arrive and I’ll open the front door and hand the attached leash to you." 
 Pet Parents can message their Pet Caregiver in-app to remind them of the request for a socially distanced service. Remember to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before handling the leash and after both pick-up and drop-off and follow advice from public health authorities like the CDC. 
 
  
 Dedicated COVID-19 Tip Function  
 To support the Pet Caregiver community in defraying the cost of additional COVID-19 related safety supplies, Pet Parents now have the option to give a “Dedicated COVID-19 Tip.” This provides a mechanism for a Pet Parent to help pay for gloves, hand sanitizer, as well as any other essential equipment.  
  
 COVID-19 Resources  
 We ask that Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers follow the guidance of the CDC and the below tips to help prevent the further spread of the virus:   
 
 If you feel sick, please stay home; don’t request services on the platform.  
 Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds if soap and water are not readily available, clean hands by using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, including immediately before and after a service is completed.  
 When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands.  
 Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick, and please seek medical care if you have a fever and symptoms, such as cough and/or difficulty breathing.  
 
What do I do if there are no available walks in my area?  
 For safety, cities and states across the country continue to adjust travel and quarantine restrictions due to COVID-19. If your area is still affected by a reduced number of Pet Parent requests, Wag! recommends using your public profile to promote your services and to remind local Pet Parents that Wag! is still here to help by providing socially distanced services. For details on how to update and self promote your Wag! Caregiver Profile click on this link.  
Further Support 
 Wag! has partnered with Stride to provide Pet Caregivers with health and financial resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. For more information on Stride and its benefits, please click this link.  
  
 We are prepared to navigate these challenging circumstances with the Wag! community’s health and safety in mind. Our services will continue, along with 24/7 customer support, and we thank you in advance for working with us to ensure the Wag! platform operates as safely as possible.  </h4>

                    <h3>Socially Distanced Pet Care Informational Session</h3>
                         <h4> The novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") remains on many of our minds. As life begins to return to normal and more Wag! Services are booked by Pet Parents, the health and safety of the Wag! community is our top priority.   
 With this in mind, we have launched an optional informational session for Pet Caregivers to learn about CDC recommendations in the context of pet care & dog walking. Most Pet Caregivers finish the session in under 5 minutes, and upon completion, the following 'Socially Distanced Pet Care' tag will be awarded to you and displayed on your profile:   
    
 IMPORTANT: When accessing the course, please enter the email address associated with your Wag! Walking account, or else we may not be able to display the tag on your profile automatically.   
 
 Frequently Asked Questions  
 
 I never got an email about this. Can I still complete the session?  Yes! You can complete the session by visiting this link.  When entering your information on the course page, please use the email address associated with your Wag! Walking account. If you use a different email, we will not be able to display the tag on your profile.  
 How can I get the Socially Distanced Pet Care tag on my profile?  As soon as you complete the informational session, the 'Socially Distanced Pet Care' tag will appear on your profile. Please allow up to 24 hours for the tag to appear, but in most cases, the tag will appear instantly.  
 I completed the session over 24 hours ago and I still haven't gotten the tag.   We're sorry to hear that! The most common cause of this issue is completing the course under an email address that is different from the email on file for your Wag! Walking account.    Please reach out to support under the 'Help' tab of the Wag! Walking app if the issue persists, and after verifying that you have fully completed the course we can manually add the tag to your profile.    
 
 Thank you for working with us to ensure the Wag! platform operates as safely as possible!  </h4>

                    <h3>Tips from Other Pet Caregivers</h3>
                         <h4>Service Animals 
 If you require a service animal, it's recommended to follow these steps:  
 
 Add the information about requiring a service animal to your public bio 
 Prior to the service, reach out to the Pet Parent and inform them of the need for the service animal 
 If the service animal assists you on the walk, please ask the pet parent if they have any safety issues with their own dogs that may put you or the animals in danger 
   
   If no, complete the service as normal 
   If yes, please submit a cover through the app  
    
 
Navigating The App 
 As an app-based platform, efficient navigation of the app can play a major role in a successful service. Pet Caregivers on the platform have found success in preparing to perform a service with Wag! by doing the following:  
 
 Completing their test walk 
 Familiarizing themselves with the app navigation and features 
 Reading the Terms of Services 
 Reading the Pet Caregivers section of the Wag! help center 
 
Keeping Keys Safe 
 A Pet Parent places a great deal of trust in Pet Caregivers to access their property and care for their dog(s). Pet Caregivers have shared the following tips for keeping a Pet Parent’s keys safe:  
 
 Put the key back in its original spot before heading out on the walk 
 Make sure the key is secure prior to ending the service 
 If for any reason you are unable to lock up, make sure to indicate this in the app upon completion of the service  
 Ensure the property is secured in the same way it was when you arrived 
 If keys are misplaced, contact the Pet Parent and Customer Service for assistance  
 
Security and Home Access 
 Staying safe and making thoughtful decisions are important to the wellbeing of Pet Caregivers, Pet Parents, and the dogs using Wag!. Pet Caregivers have found success in staying safe and making thoughtful decisions by doing the following:  
 
 Entering a Pet Parent's home through designated doors / entries 
 Avoiding unsafe situations 
 Avoiding entering or accessing areas of the home not necessary to completing a service 
 Remaining aware of their surroundings 
 
Picking Up After The Pup 
 Dog waste can spread disease and become a smelly nuisance. In addition, many jurisdictions will issue a citation for dog waste that has not been picked up. Pet Caregivers have shared the following suggestions:  
 
 Before leaving on the walk, be sure you have something handy to pick up after the dog(s) 
 Clean up the dog’s waste while on the walk 
 It is a good idea to keep a few bags on hand at all times 
 If a citation is issued, work respectfully with the local officials while communicating with the Pet Parent and Wag! customer service

 Tips for Creating a Strong Password  
 Wag! takes your account security seriously, and choosing a secure password helps protect your account against unauthorized use. Here are some of the best practices to follow when creating a password:   
 
 Straight rows of keys are easy to guess.  
 Short keyboard patterns are easy to guess.  
 Use a longer keyboard pattern with more turns.  
 Repeats like "aaa" are easy to guess.  
 Sequences like "abc" or "6543" are easy to guess. 
 Repeats like "abcabcabc" are only slight harder to guess than "abc".  
 Avoid dates and years that are associated with you.  
 Avoid recent years.  
 Capitalization does not help very much.  
 Reversed words aren't much harder to guess.  
 All uppercase is almost as easy to guess as all lower case.  
 Avoid predictable substitutions like "@" instead of at.  
 
 In addition to the above tips, we recommend your password includes:  
 
 More than eight characters 
 Both upper- and lower-case letters 
 A mix of numbers and special characters (i.e., # @ $ % &) 
 
I can't change my password! 
 If you can't update your password or are receiving an "Invalid Input" error message, please follow the Strong Password guidelines above (or click here).  </h4>

 Feeding instructions 
 Special needs 
 Likes and dislikes
