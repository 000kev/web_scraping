          <h1> How do I use Rover's video call feature?</h1>
               <h4>
      One alternative to in-person Meet & Greets is scheduling a video call. This way, you can have face-to-face interactions to discuss the needs of a pending request.
Note: Currently, the video calls are not available in California, Canada or the EU.
Here's what you need to know about Rover's video call tool:

At this time, video calls are only available on the Rover app for iOS devices.
You can only make a video call for Pending Requests. Once you confirm a request, the video call option will no longer be available.
Both owners and sitters can initiate a video call.

You can make a video call for a pending request at any time, but it's best to schedule a time that works with you and your client's schedule. You can discuss a time via Rover Messages.
To start a video call: 
1. Open the Rover app and navigate to your pending request.  In Rover Messages, tap the Call option. 

 
2. Tap Video Call.
 
3. Tap OK to give the Rover app access to your camera. This is required to use the video call tool.
 
4. The app will display the name of the person you're calling. To end the video call, tap Cancel call below.
 
5. Once your client answers, they'll be displayed on the larger screen. Use the different camera icons on the left to customize your display preferences. You can also turn off your microphone while the other person is speaking to reduce background noise. To use this feature, tap the gray microphone icon.
 
6. Once the video call ends, you'll be redirected to the conversation thread in Rover Messages. You can make as many video calls as you like with someone, as long as the request is pending. Once you confirm the request, you'll no longer see the option to initiate a video call.

               <h4>
      Some localities in California require you to have a business license or registration in order to offer your services. If you’d like to provide services as an independent pet sitter or dog walker, make sure you follow the local laws required to do business in your area, as required by the Rover Terms of Service. This can also help ensure that you’re paying all of the local and state taxes required in your area. 
Rover can’t provide legal advice, but we’d like to offer you some general information and links that may help you better understand local business licensing or registration requirements. This page is not comprehensive, but we hope it’ll point you in the right direction. Please remember other laws or requirements not mentioned here may apply to you.

If you don’t see your city listed, then please check your city or county website for information about local requirements. Note: If you have questions or are unsure about how laws might apply to you, it's a good idea to seek legal or tax advice.

      Rover exists to make it easier to have a dog in your life. We do this by providing an innovative and secure platform, offering 24/7 customer support, and building better tools. Service fees allow Rover to operate and continually make improvements based on the needs of our growing community.

Pet sitters and dog walkers are the cornerstone of our business. Without their passion, hard work, and devotion to providing amazing pet care, we wouldn't be here. We're here to provide ongoing support, educational opportunities, and to help each individual grow their business—and we’re in it for the long haul. These fees help us do that, along with facilitating Rover’s customer support, 24/7 trust and safety coverage, and important site maintenance and product improvements. They also help cover benefits for sitters, including the costs of processing payments and ongoing promotion of sitters on Rover.
Owners
Beginning in September 2015, bookings by new account holders are charged a service fee to support Rover’s operating costs, and cover state and local taxes, where applicable.
Services booked through a Rover account created prior to the date the fee was implemented will not be subject to the owner service fee. The fee cannot exceed $50/booking ($35 CAD/booking in Canada). It’s refundable should the booking be canceled by either the sitter or the owner, in accordance with your sitter’s cancellation policy. If the booking dates change, the fee will be updated accordingly. 
FAQ
How do these fees impact my business?
For pet sitters and dog walkers on Rover, these fees are designed to support you every step of the way, and they’re standard in our industry. We use these standard service fees to do things like:

Continually improve your experience with the Rover website and mobile apps.
Expand our Trust & Safety team to offer best-in-class 24/7 emergency support. (That means whenever you call, we’ll be there to answer.)
Create original educational content specifically for sitters in our Sitter Resources Center and Help Center.

In short, these fees help us build our business so we can help you build yours.
 
If I left Rover as a sitter prior to March 2016 and then come back, what will my service fee be?
If your sitter profile was originally created and approved before March 1, 2016, you’ll pay a 15% service fee for each booking.

          <h1> How do I review my payments from my Rover bookings?</h1>
               <h4>
      Keeping track of your payments through Rover is easy. You can get payment details on every stay or walk you’ve booked, all through your Payment History.
 
1. Navigate to your Dashboard by selecting your name in the upper right corner of your screen. 

2. Under Rover Balance, select View Payments & Promo Codes.

3. Your payment history is broken into five tabs; Earnings, Pending Earnings, Withdrawals, Payments, & Other. Each tab has a complete list of all corresponding payments or bookings. They are sorted by date.
 
4. On the right side of the page you’ll also see your current Rover Balance, Withdrawal History by Year, External Withdrawal History*, and Donations. 
 
*If you were previously a DogVacay sitter, this External Withdrawal History section would reflect payments you received from DogVacay. 
 
Here’s a breakdown of each section:



Earnings
All of your completed bookings.


Pending Earnings

Your current or upcoming bookings, that have not yet been paid out yet. 



Withdrawals

Funds that you’ve transferred out of Rover via check or PayPal. 



Payments

Bookings that have been completed for your own pets to a Rover sitter.



Other
Coupons, background check fees, and reversal of service deposits.



 
Note about reversal of service deposits: This happens when a partial or full refund is issued for a service that a sitter has already withdrawn funds for. This typically occurs when a sitter withdraws funds for a stay that is either shortened or cancelled and requires Rover to issue a refund to the client.

          <h1> What are sitter performance scores?</h1>
               <h4>
      Sitter Performance Scores give you a sense of how you’re performing compared to other sitters and walkers on the platform, and they influence your profile ranking in search. The higher your score, the better your placement in relevant search results on Rover.
Important to Know:

Your scores are private and can only be viewed by you.
You’ll never be penalized for declining requests that aren’t compatible with your listed preferences and calendar availability. For instance, if the client has a Great Dane and your profile states that you only accept small dogs, your scores won’t be affected if you decline the request.

Types of scoresViewing performance scoresImproving your booking scoreImproving your repeat score
Types of scores
Each of the services you offer have two types of scores: a booking score, and a repeat score.
Booking score
This score consists of your overall booking rate, which looks at the number of new clients who contact you for the first time and measures that against how many of them end up booking with you and leaving you a positive review. 
Repeat score
Your repeat score tells you how often your first-time clients book with you again. If you haven’t booked enough repeat clients to generate a score yet, then it may appear in gray.
Viewing performance scores
You can view these scores from your sitter account on a computer by selecting your name in the upper right corner of the screen and selecting View Performance Scores.
If you offer more than one service, you’ll have a different score for each one. Toggle between them by selecting the dropdown menu next to Your Performance Scores.

Note: If you see N/A as a score for one of your services, then it might you haven’t received or booked enough requests to generate a score yet. As you book more requests and build repeat bookings with clients, you’ll eventually receive a score for that service.
Improving your booking score
Here are some ways to ensure that you receive a high booking score :

Respond to every request you receive in a timely manner, even if you’re unable to accept the request. Being communicative is key to running a successful business. It also ensures that you maintain a high response rate.
Book as many requests as you can accept. This will help you maintain a high booking rate.
Encourage clients to leave reviews. Positive reviews not only factor into your performance scores, but they also demonstrate your trustworthiness to new clients.
Regularly update your calendar to ensure that it reflects your availability. Learn how.


Create an inviting, authentic, and thorough profile that details your preferences.

Improving your repeat score
Here are some tips to encourage pet owners to book with you again:

Send frequent photo and text updates to your clients during bookings. Learn more.
Be accessible and communicate often with your clients.
Provide 5-star care, whether it’s your first or 10th booking with a client.
Give loyal clients a heads up about your availability before busy seasons or vacations.
Ask clients to book with you again next time. Learn more.
Never accept cash or checks—always book on Rover. Learn more.

Additional information

We recommend contacting two to three sitters or dog walkers when beginning your search. That way you’ll have lots of options when you’re ready to book your first service.
If you're requesting care for multiple pets, then each of your pets must have a completed profile and be added to the booking. Learn how to add a pet profile to your account.

          <h1> How do you evaluate sitters and dog walkers?</h1>
               <h4>
      As pet parents ourselves, we know your dog is a member of your family and we want you to feel confident in your choice of sitter or dog walker. 
Every sitter and dog walker who lists their services on Rover has been thoroughly reviewed by the Rover Sitter team. Sitters and dog walkers must be at least 18 years old. They must also:

build a profile with details about their pet care experience
upload photos
 request testimonials from past clients
complete a background check
take a safety quiz

Rover also provides ongoing educational opportunities so sitters and dog walkers have the tools they need to offer world-class care. We also provide the Rover Guarantee for all stays and walks booked through Rover.
Tip: Before booking with a sitter, we always recommend scheduling an in-person Meet & Greet. This way, you can see whether your sitter or dog walker is the perfect fit.

          <h1> How does the sitter profile review process work?</h1>
               <h4>
      Every sitter profile is manually reviewed by the Rover sitter team. We evaluate each profile to determine whether it meets our unique set of quality standards. If we decide the sitter or dog walker is a good fit for Rover, we’ll approve their profile, and they can then list pet care services on the site.
What are some of the reasons my profile might not be approved?
Review and approval of sitters and dog walkers ultimately centers around the question, “Do we believe dog owners will have a great experience with this sitter or dog walker?”
There are a lot of reasons why a profile might not be approved. Here are a few of the biggest ones:

Sitters and dog walkers on Rover are a unique blend of caring and professional. If we don’t feel a profile exhibits those traits, it may not be approved.
For sitters offering in-home services, it’s not evident that they can provide the individualized experience our pet parents are looking for. Rover was designed to be an alternative to kennels by offering one-on-one attention and personalized care for dogs.
The information in the sitter’s profile doesn’t show us they’re able to safely separate the large number number of dogs they want to accept at one time. This could include the profile description and/or photos of the sitter’s home.
The sitter already has a large number of animals in their home that may prevent them from providing a safe experience for additional pets. 

Can I appeal the approval decision?
Finding sitters and dog walkers who are the right fit for Rover is something we take very seriously. We do everything we can to be thorough the first time around, and for that reason the approval decision is final and cannot be appealed.
Can I still use Rover to book a stay or walk for my dog?
Absolutely. You’re still welcome to book stays for your own pets through Rover. Although you can’t access your sitter profile anymore, you can still access your account, including your payment information. 
Can I retrieve my pictures, profile content, and testimonials?
Once a sitter profile is deactivated, profile access is disabled—that includes access to any photos or information the sitter added to their profile when creating it.

               <h4>
      Rover offers the Rover Guarantee for all services booked through Rover. Simply put, the Rover Guarantee is our commitment to you in the rare instance that something goes wrong during a booking.
The Rover Guarantee reimburses members of our community for costs arising from certain injuries or damages that occur during a service booked and paid through Rover. The injuries or damages must result from care provided during a Rover stay or walk, and the Guarantee reimburses in the event the sitter or walker is unwilling or unable to pay those costs. 
To learn more about the Rover Guarantee, including more details on what's covered, minimum contributions and limits, check out our Rover Guarantee page and Rover Guarantee Terms and Conditions.

          <h1> What's a W-9? Do I need to submit one to Rover?</h1>
               <h4>
      Rover is not a tax advisor and cannot provide advice about taxes, income reporting, or unemployment.
A Form W-9 allows you to submit taxpayer identification information (i.e. social security number or tax identification number) to another company. If you are a U.S. taxpayer and redeem earnings via check, Rover will require you to complete a Form W-9.
How do I verify whether I need to submit a W-9 to Rover?
If we don’t already have a W-9 on file for you, you’ll be prompted to fill out a W-9  the next time you withdraw funds via check, as pictured below. Rover must receive a completed W-9 back from you before issuing  your payments by check.
If you don’t see this prompt when withdraw funds via check, that means we already have a W-9 on file for you. You do not need to submit another W-9.

If you need to complete a W-9 form, please email Rover at 1099@rover.com to request one. You should receive a response from Rover within 2 business days..
What if I receive payments for Rover bookings via PayPal?
If you redeem all your earnings via Paypal, you don’t need to submit a W-9 to Rover. This is because Rover does not handle tax documentation for redemptions made via PayPal. If you have tax-related questions regarding earnings processed on PayPal, please consult a tax expert or contact PayPal directly.
Note: Anyone who redeems their earnings via check will be prompted to complete a W-9, but not all sitters/walkers who complete one will be eligible to receive a 1099 form. For more information about 1099s, check out this article.

          <h1> How can I have a safe, stress-free stay? </h1>
               <h4>
      Whether you’re hosting a dog at your place or traveling to a client’s home, Rover provides all the tools you’ll need for a fun, safe, and stress-free stay.

First, review the Rover Community Guidelines for pet owners and sitters. 
When you’re ready to begin booking, remember to always schedule a Meet & Greet to get to know your client and their dog and establish clear expectations on what to expect during the stay. Learn more about how to prepare for a Meet & Greet here. 
Communicate early, and communicate often with your client. This ensures that both you and your client have set the right expectations before, during, and after the booking. 
Provide photo updates. Photos play an important role in building trust with a client. Learn how to share photo updates here.
Check out Rover 101—it’s packed with essential knowledge so you can anticipate your client’s needs before they arise. When finished, take the Sitter Success Quiz to earn your Rover 101 badge that future clients will see on your sitter profile.

          <h1> What's the difference between a dog review and dog notes? </h1>
               <h4>
      A dog review allows you to share feedback with Rover Support about a specific pet you cared for during a stay. This allows us to reference a pet's history to ensure safe pet sitting experience on Rover for sitters and their client's pets.
Pet reviews are not viewable to you, your client, or other sitters. Once you submit a pet review, you will only be able to see the star rating. The written portion will only be visible to the Rover Support team.
Dog notes are a great resource for sitters who want to keep a record of information about a dog that they can reference later. Dog notes are only available to you, and you can reference them at any time from the dog's profile.
How to leave a review
Rover app 

Open the completed booking you'd like to review. 
Tap Leave Review. 
Provide a star rating, write your review, then select Submit Rating.  

Computer

Navigate to Past Stays from your inbox.

Important information

Booking and paying through Rover is required per our Terms of Service. 
Never pay your sitter or dog walker by cash or check—this can expose you to fraud and makes your bookings ineligible for the Rover Guarantee and 24/7 support. 
If you modified your pending request to include additional dates or pets, then your bank account will be debited for the new price. The previous charge for the initial request will appear on your bank account as well, but it will drop off once the new charge is finalized.
Please contact your sitter directly if you need to make changes to your booking. Once they agree to the changes, they can make the necessary updates to the booking from their end.

               <h4>
      Rover is not a tax advisor and cannot provide advice about taxes, income reporting, or unemployment.
If you’ve withdrawn $600 or more via check over the course of a calendar year, Rover will send you a 1099 tax form to the address listed on your W-9 by January 31. An electronic copy of your 1099 will also be emailed via tax1099.com by January 31.
If you receive payments via PayPal, then you won’t receive tax documentation from Rover. Since PayPal distributes these funds to you, it is responsible for handling your tax documentation in accordance with its own tax reporting practices.

For more  information on how PayPal reports sales to the IRS, check out this PayPal article.
To learn more, see this IRS document: Instructions for Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC

What if I don’t meet the requirements to receive a 1099 from Rover?
The fact that your payments on Rover do not reach $600 in a tax year does not relieve you of your obligation to report and pay taxes for income received through the Rover platform. We encourage you to consult with a tax advisor to better understand your requirements.

For more information, visit the IRS website about gig economy workers and 1099/W9 information.
