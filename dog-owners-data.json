            "How Wag! Works",
            "Setting Your Rates\nWhat is Dynamic Pricing?\n\nTo best support the Pet Caregivers using Wag!, we’ve created the Dynamic Pricing feature, which allows Pet Caregivers to set their own rates as business owners. Dynamic Pricing is the ability for Pet Caregivers to set their own rates for services and “extras” such as the additional dog and weekly walk surcharges. \n\nCan I set my own rates?\n\nYes, Dynamic Pricing will allow you, as an independent business owner, to set your own rates for services completed through the Wag! platform. Pet Caregivers are able to set their own pricing for:\n\n20, 30, and 60 minute Walks\nOvernight Care (per night)\nAdditional dog fees\nWeekly Walk surcharges\nDrop-Ins\nDigital & In-Home Training sessions\nHow do I set my own rates?\n\nYou can update your rates or \"Service Pricing\" at any time by tapping “Change Bid” in the Walk Details of an available service. From here, you can adjust your pricing to whatever you believe is fair. You can also adjust your pricing at any time; any adjustments you make will not affect services that you have already booked with a Pet Parent. If you increase a rate after booking a service, you will still receive your initial bid as the service payout, not the new rate.\n\nHow do I bid on a service?\n\nYou can change your “bid” or pricing at any time before opting into a service. Once you submit your bid by opting into the service, the pricing for that service cannot be changed. After you request a service, no further action is required. If you are matched to the Pet Parent, you will be notified and the service will appear on your “Booked” tab. \n\nAm I setting the payout amount or the cost of the service?\n\nWhen you set your rates in the app, you are setting your desired payout for the service. You will see what the Pet Parent will pay for that service directly below your set rates.\n\nCan Pet Parents still tip?\n\nYes, Pet Parents are still able and encouraged to tip. The tip percentage is calculated from the total cost to the Pet Parent.\n\nWhat does “Average price in my area” mean?\n\nThe “Average Price” is the cumulative average price that other Pet Caregivers in your area are charging for the same service type. The “Average Price” is only a suggestion; you are free to set your rates how you wish. Please note that out-of-range pricing may affect Pet Parents’ demand for your services.\n\nWhat is a “Weekly Walk Surcharge?”\n\nThe Weekly Walk Surcharge is the additional payout you will receive per service on a Recurring Schedule.\n\nWhat is Wag!?\n\nWag! is the #1 app for pet parents -- offering 5-star dog walking, pet sitting, veterinary care, and training services nationwide.\n\nBook convenient pet care in your neighborhood with the Wag! app. Whether you’re looking for daily walks, planning a trip, stuck at work, or just want your best friend to have some company - any day, anytime pet care is available through the app.\n\n \n\nHere when you need pet care.\n\nOn-demand and scheduled dog walks based on your and your dog’s needs.\nBoarding and sitting overnight care in your home or the Pet Caregiver’s.\nDrop-in visits for dogs who don’t need a walk, but could use a potty break.\nVeterinary consultations to answer your pet health questions from the convenience of your home, available around the clock.\nOne-on-one personalized in-home dog training.\n\nSafety is serious business.\n\nEvery Pet Caregiver with Wag! is thoroughly vetted and undergoes a comprehensive screening.\nSupport is standing by and available to you and your pet 24/7.\n\nAll about convenience.\n\nGPS-tracked walks so you can follow along with your dog’s walk in real-time.\nIn-app messaging so you can easily communicate with your Pet Caregiver.\nReceive live pee/poop notifications and a detailed report card at the end of your service.\nBook and pay for your services securely within the app.\nWag! lockboxes are available for simplified home access.\nChat live with board certified veterinary professionals for expert pet health advice\n\nWe’ve been around the block.\n\nOur community of 150,000+ Pet Caregivers nationwide are dog people, and it shows.\nPet Caregivers with Wag! have a trusted record of experience with over 10 million pet care services across 4,600+ cities.\nWe’ve donated over 10 million meals!

If you are booking with a past or preferred Pet Caregiver, their rates can be found on their public profile, which you can view under the \"Past Caregivers\" tab on the Wag! app. If you're new to the platform, rates will be displayed at the bottom of the screen during booking.\n\nWhat is Dynamic Pricing?\n\nTo best support the Pet Caregivers using Wag!, we’ve created the Dynamic Pricing feature, which allows Pet Caregivers to set their own rates as business owners. Dynamic Pricing is the ability for Pet Caregivers to set their own rates for services and “extras” such as the additional dog and weekly walk surcharges. \n\nIs my tip separate from the listed price?\n\nYes, you still have the option to tip on all Wag! Services. A tip is not included in the listed price.\n\nWhy is the cost of services different every time?\n\nYou will not be charged outside the range listed in the app, but the price may vary within that range. Pet Caregivers are free to update their pricing at any time, effective for all future services. Once a schedule has been booked, they cannot change the rate for that individual service. \n\nWhat is a Booking Fee?\n\nWag! charges a booking fee of $1.99 for each schedule booked. Note that you will only be charged one booking fee if you book a recurring or multi-day schedule. There is no booking fee for Wag! Premium members.\n\nCan I book multiple services at the same rate with the same Pet Caregiver?\n\nYes. You can book a multi-day, one-time schedule, or a recurring schedule with the same Pet Caregiver. For multi-day and single Pet Caregiver recurring services, the rate will be the same for each service on the schedule.\n\nDo I pay the same if my Pet Caregiver I selected submits a cover/cancels?\n\nIf your Pet Caregiver submits a cover, Wag! will search for another Pet Caregiver near you to complete the service as originally scheduled. You will pay the same amount for the service.\n\nCan a Pet Caregiver change their pricing after I accept their bid?\n\nNo, Pet Caregivers are unable to change their price bid once you have confirmed the service."

You can also give your Pet Caregiver a badge for a job well done!\n\n \n\nWhat are Pet Caregiver Badges?\n\nAbove and Beyond: Pet Caregiver went the extra mile for your dog!\nExcellent Report Card: Pet Caregiver left a fun and informative report card.\nExtra Caring: Pet Caregiver made sure your dog got some extra TLC!\nFollows Instructions: Pet Caregiver did a great job at following instructions.\nGreat Distance: Pet Caregiver was able to cover a lot of ground during the walk.\nStrong Walker: Pet Caregiver was able to handle larger/energetic dog breeds.\nBest Practices for Pet Parents\nAdequate Equipment \n\nAs a pet parent, it’s your responsibility to provide adequate equipment for your pet caregiver before the service begins. Before each scheduled service, check to make sure that you have provided the supplies your pet caregiver will need.  For example, if you’ve booked a walk, ensure you’ve left a leash, harness and bags in plain sight for your walker to find. If you’ve booked an in-home service like a Boarding or Pet Day Care, ensure you’ve provided your dog’s bowls, food or other supplies necessary for a safe and successful service. \n\nIf you’ve booked a Boarding or Pet Day Care service with a transportation component, it’s important that your pet caregiver knows how to safely and securely transport your dog from your home to theirs, and back! It's the responsibility of the pet parent to provide adequate equipment for a safe and smooth transport.  This can include a dog seat belt or harness and/or crate. Crates are a good option to help ensure the pup’s safety when traveling, especially in a car. If you already use a crate, be sure the crate is the right size for the dog being transported and that it can fit in most vehicles. Also, note that crates should be securely anchored to the vehicle.  Since this can be done in a variety of ways, be sure you choose the correct option for both the dog and crate being used. \n\nHome Access\n\nIn order to get things off to a successful start, the pet caregiver needs smooth access to the home to pick up the dog. As a pet parent, be sure to provide information about accessing your home within the Wag! app or on our website. \n\nWe highly encourage pet parents to change lockbox codes often and not to share personal information, including phone numbers, with Pet Care Providers. When changing your lockbox code, don’t forget to update this information within the Wag! app so upcoming pet caregivers have the information they need.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe Wag! app is the best channel for communication between you and your pet caregiver. We encourage pet parents to communicate and engage with pet caregivers solely through the Wag! app or our website.\n\nRemember that pet caregivers may have questions and direct communication through the app keeps everyone informed. Timely communication is also important for a successful service. Try to respond to pet caregivers as soon as possible, especially if questions arise during a service. We encourage pet parents to keep their mobile devices close during a walk or boarding or sitting engagement. The Wag! app has user safety features that allow you to communicate with pet caregivers safely and conveniently. Use it! \n\nDog’s Information\n\nAs a best practice, confirm that your dog's profile is filled out adequately, updated as needed, and includes any special details you may want to convey to your pet caregiver.\n\nTimeliness\n\nIf you’re dropping off your dog for a Boarding or Day Care service, be respectful of the agreement you've made with the boarding host and arrive on time.\n\nCancellations\n\nIn the event of a last-minute change to their plans or schedule, pet parents have the option to cancel a Wag! scheduled service. Last-minute cancellations can have a negative impact on our community by disrupting schedules and experiences of both pet parents and pet caregivers. Please be mindful of this and keep last-minute cancellations to a minimum.\n\nStar Ratings\nWhat's a Star Rating?\n\nA Pet Caregiver’s overall rating is an average of all individual ratings they have received divided by the total amount of services they have provided. Wag! uses a rating system to obtain feedback and continuously improve service quality. This system provides a quick and clear way to rate your Wag! service experience each and every time. \n\nWhat does each Star Rating mean?\n\n5 Stars: Great experience! Everything was as described in my notes, Pet Caregiver did a great job executing the service.\n\n4 Stars: Good experience; One or two things could have been done better.\n\n3 Stars: Neutral experience; I’m disappointed in the quality of this service, but I would book again with a different Pet Caregiver. \n\n2 Stars: Bad experience; Pet Caregiver did/did not do something which was a fundamental part of executing a successful service. I don’t want to use this Pet Caregiver again. \n\n1 Star: Horrible experience; Multiple things went wrong or there was a single significant failure in delivering the service.\n\nFor a 5- or 4-star rating, you'll be prompted to add the Pet Caregiver to your Preferred Walkers list (click the \"heart\" icon). You may also choose to award the Pet Caregiver a badge and/or leave a tip! For 3-stars or below, you'll be asked if you'd like to block the Pet Caregiver from being able to accept future services for your pets. "

Credit packages are non-refundable.\n\nHow do I add a promo code?\nGo to the “Payments” tab in the sidebar→\nClick “Apply a Promo Code” →\nEnter the Promo Code →\nClick “Apply”. You’re all set!  \n\nIf you receive an error message when redeeming a code, please check that you meet all the requirements to receive the discount.\n\nPre-Authorization\nWhat is pre-authorization?\n\nWhen a service has been requested and/or a Pet Caregiver is being assigned to your requested service, Wag! will make a pre-authorization hold to the card on file, for an amount equal to the cost of the service being booked. \n\nNOTE: A pre-authorization will appear as a pending charge on your bank account and will only be submitted as a charge upon completion of the service. You may even receive an alert from your financial institution for the hold, but no formal charge will occur until the service is completed by the caregiver. \n\nWhen does Wag! pre-authorize a transaction?\n\nWag! will pre-authorize any transaction being paid with a credit card. Transactions paid in full with Apple Pay or with Wag! credits will not be subject to preauthorization. For overnight services (including Sitting & Boarding), pre-authorization will occur when the service is booked. For all other services, pre-authorization will occur when a Pet Caregiver has opted-in to the service.\n\nWhat if I cancel the service?\n\nIf you should cancel the service, the pre-authorization will be immediately removed. Note that cancelled services may be subject to a cancellation fee. \n\nHow much is the pre-authorization?\n\nThe pre-authorization will equal the total cost of the service being booked, including applicable booking fees. If you have any credits on your account, the pre-authorization amount will be the cost of the service minus any redeemable credits.\n\nNote: If you have enough credits on your account to cover the entire cost of the service, your card on file will not be pre-authorized.\n\nHow will pre-authorization appear on my credit or billing statement?\n\nPre-authorization will appear as a pending transaction on your bank statement. Your bank may alert you of a charge to your account, however, this represents the pre-authorization hold, not a charge. The hold will only be submitted as a charge upon completion of the service.\n\nWhen can I expect a hold to appear and when will it disappear?\n\nFor Overnight Services (Boardings and Sittings)\n\nA pre-authorization hold will occur the same day the service is requested. \nThe hold will remain on the account until the service is completed and the account is successfully charged.\nOnce a charge is successful, the hold should automatically disappear within 24 hrs, but may take longer depending on your financial institution processing times. \nIf the service cancels, the hold will automatically be removed and should reflect immediately in the account but may take longer depending on your financial institution (NOTE: Services cancelled may be subject to a cancellation fee).\n\nFor All Other Services (Walks, Drop-ins, Trainings, Wag! Health)\n\nA pre-authorization hold will occur when a Pet Caregiver has opted-in to the service.\nIf you have an active recurring schedule, pre-authorizations will typically occur within 48hrs of the start time of the walk or when the caregiver is assigned to the walk. \nOnce a charge is successful, the hold should automatically disappear within 24 hrs, but may take longer depending on your financial institution processing times. \nIf the service cancels, the hold will automatically be removed and should reflect immediately in the account but may take longer depending on your financial institution (NOTE: Services cancelled may be subject to a cancellation fee).\nWhy does Wag! pre-authorize transactions?\n\nAs of April 1, 2020, preauthorization is required to verify that sufficient funds are available to cover the cost of the service.\n\nWhy do I have two charges for the same transaction?\n\nOne of these “charges” is a pre-authorization. The pre-authorization will fall off within 24 hours. If you’re still noticing a pre-authorization on your account after 24 hours, please contact your banking institution.\n\nWhat will happen if a pre-authorization fails?\n\nIf Wag! is unable to successfully pre-authorize the card on file, you will receive a notification that the service could not be approved.\n\nCancellation Fees\nI need to cancel a walk, is there a fee?\n\nCancellations within 24 hours of your walk schedule will incur a $5 cancellation fee and $25 for Overnight Services. \n\nWhat if it's more than 24 hours?\n\nCancellations more than 24 hours in advance do NOT incur a cancellation fee.\n\nHow do I cancel a service/walk?\nOpen the Main Menu from the top left of the home screen →\nTap \"Schedule\" →\nTap on the date with the specific service you'd like to cancel →\nOn the service details screen, scroll down, and tap \"Cancel\"\nGoogle Pay\nWhat is Google Pay?\n\nGoogle Pay is a digital wallet platform and online payment system developed by Google to power in-app and tap-to-pay purchases and is also an accepted method of payment on the Wag!

As we all continue to monitor the situation very closely, we wanted to share that Pet Caregivers continue to be available for walking, sitting, boarding, and training on the Wag! platform. The health and safety for Pet Caregivers, Pet Parents, and their dogs are and always will be our highest priority. In situations such as this, we understand that we need to evolve the Wag! platform to help do our part to best serve the community as safely as possible. \n\nBelow you’ll find information on recent platform changes, including Socially Distanced Services, the dedicated COVID-19 Tip function, and our COVID-19 Resource Center and FAQs. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as they become available.\n\n \n\nSocially Distanced Services\n\nPet Parents may update their Home Access notes to request a service as a socially distanced service and to provide specific instructions to help limit physical interactions. Here is an example of simple measures you can take when performing socially distanced services:\n\nRequesting a “socially distanced service” -- When requesting a walk through the Wag! platform, pet parents can update the \"How to get in\" section with the socially distanced service request and any relevant instructions to help limit interaction. For example: \"Socially Distanced Service - I’ll have Fido ready with a harness and leash on. Please knock or message me in-app when you arrive and I’ll open the front door and hand the attached leash to you.\"\nPreparing your dog -- Put on the dog’s harness and leash in advance of the pick-up and walk.\nEnsuring a smooth handoff -- Pet Parents can message their Pet Caregiver in-app to remind them of the request for a socially distanced service. When the Pet Caregiver arrives, simply hand the leash off. Lastly, remember to wash your hands before handling the leash and after both pick-up and drop-off and follow advice from public health authorities like the CDC.\n\n \n\nDedicated COVID-19 Tip Function\n\nTo support the Pet Caregiver community in defraying the cost of additional COVID-19 related safety supplies, pet parents now have the option to give a “Dedicated COVID-19 Tip.” This provides a mechanism for a Pet Parent to help pay for gloves, hand sanitizer, as well as any other essential equipment.\n\n \n\nCOVID-19 Resource Center and FAQs\n\nFor your informational purposes, we have created a COVID-19 Resource Center and Frequently Asked Questions article so you can keep yourself updated on the impact and best practices for you and your pets with the Wag! platform. We’ll continue to update the community on additional solutions and recommendations to help Pet Parents stay safe and healthy during these unique times.\n\n \n\nWe ask that Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers follow the guidance of the CDC and the below tips to help prevent the further spread of the virus: \n\nIf you or a household member feel sick, please help keep Pet Caregivers safe.\nFrequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds if soap and water are not readily available, clean hands by using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, including immediately before and after a service is completed. \nWhen coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands. \nAvoid close contact with anyone who is sick, and please seek medical care if you have a fever and symptoms, such as cough and/or difficulty breathing. \n\n \n\nWe are prepared to navigate these challenging circumstances with the Wag! community’s health and safety in mind. Our services will continue, along with 24/7 customer support, and we thank you in advance for working with us to ensure the Wag! platform operates as safely as possible."

To ensure the safety of your dog, we do not recommend any off-leash activities beyond your home’s fenced yard.\n\nDo pet caregivers walk my dog with other people’s dogs?\n\nNo. Your pup is the sole focus on each walk. Each pup has different needs, and the best way to serve those needs is through a one-on-one experience. In the case that you have more than one dog in your household, pet caregivers will walk them together per your request, up to three dogs at a time."
