If you've always been a little confused about your child care choices, use this handy list to help sort through the details.\nBabysitter\nBabysitters are child care providers that work either in your home or occasionally out of their own home. They usually earn an hourly rate and often have jobs with several families. Babysitters most often are part-time caregivers, but may work full-time as well. They can range in age from 11-90, though you'll only find sitters aged 18 and up on Sittercity.com.\nMother's Helper\nMothers' helpers are babysitters in training. They are just like babysitters except that the parent is in the house while the helper is watching the kids. This is an excellent option if you are just getting used to using child care, want some uninterrupted time to get extra work done or want to give a babysitter a trial period.\nNanny\nA nanny typically lives inside a family's home or travels to it daily, works for one family at a time, and receives a weekly salary. Nannies generally consider themselves to be full-time care providers, but many families employ part-time nannies as well.\nManny\nA male nanny. Some \"mannies\" consider the term derogatory, so be sensitive to this sentiment, especially in the presence of a male child care provider.\nAu Pair\nAn au pair is a foreign adult between the ages of 18 and 26 who comes to the United States to live with and work for an American family as a primary caregiver. In exchange, the au pair receives room and board, and a small monetary allowance. An au pair is treated as another family member and typically stays with an American family for one to two years. (Different countries have different regulations and programs.)\nDoula\nDoulas are specially trained labor assistants that help mothers prepare for a birth and can help during the actual birthing process. Doulas can also be postpartum doulas, who come in after you return from the hospital to handle a baby's night feedings, change diapers and more."

This means that the sitter has updated their availability in the past 30 days, and is available for work at the displayed date(s) and time(s). On Android, only general availability will show via bullets (e.g., \"generally free weeknights\"). We're working to add confirmed availability to Android as soon as possible.\n\nOnce you find a sitter you like, we recommend reaching out directly to the sitter to set up an interview or booking. And now on Android, you can send an interview request through our platform for the first time!\n \nSitter Availability FAQ's\n\nIs there a way I can search for sitters whose availability matches my needs?\n\nYes -- you can search by availability! Learn how to here.\n\n\nHow do I know the sitter is really available when they say?\n\nConfirmed availability is the strongest indication that a sitter will be available, since it must be updated on a monthly basis. To get a further confirmation, most parents either send an interview request (on Android) or message the sitter directly (on the web).\n\n\nAre sitters only available when they say?\n\nEven if a sitter doesn’t appear to be available, you may message them directly (or send an interview request on Android) for any time desired.\n\n\nHow do I find sitters with confirmed availability?\n\nSitters with confirmed availability are more likely to appear at the top of search results, since they are generally more active. At this time, there is no way to directly search for sitters by their availability. \n\n\nAre sitters with confirmed availability better/vetted?\n\nAt this time, there is no difference between sitters who have confirmed availability and those who don’t. Instead, you can view their reviews, badges, and references to gauge the quality of a sitter on our site.\n\n\nWhat do I do if I like a sitter without confirmed availability? Does that mean they are inactive?\n\nSitters may be a great fit for your family, even if they don’t have confirmed availability. To see if they’re active, you can see their last login on their profile. \n\n\n\n \n "

If you've always been a little confused about these terms, use this handy list to help sort through the details.\nBabysitter\nBabysitters are child care providers that work either in a family's home or occasionally out of their own home. They usually earn an hourly rate and often have jobs with several families. Babysitters most often are part-time caregivers, but may work full-time as well. They can range in age from 11-90, though only sitters aged 18 and up are allowed on Sittercity.com.\nMother's Helper\nMothers' helpers are babysitters in training. They are just like babysitters except that the parent is in the house while the helper is watching the kids. This is an excellent option if a family is just getting used to using child care, or if a family wants some uninterrupted time to get extra work done, or wants to give a babysitter a trial period.\nNanny\nA nanny typically lives inside a family's home or travels to it daily, works for one family at a time, and receives a weekly salary. Nannies generally consider themselves to be full-time care providers, but many families employ part-time nannies as well.\nManny\nA male nanny. Some \"mannies\" consider the term derogatory, so be sensitive to this sentiment. \nDoula\nDoulas are specially trained labor assistants that help mothers prepare for a birth and can help during the actual birthing process. Doulas can also be postpartum doulas, who come in after a mother returns from the hospital to handle a baby's night feedings, diaper changes, and more."

Please review these before uploading your photo.\n\nBe your best you: Have good lighting and a bright smile!\n\n           \n\nUse a clear photo of yourself: Headshots are best — at a minimum, the photo must clearly show you from chin to forehead.\n\n\n\nBe close: We recommend a photo in which you are no more than 6 feet away from the camera.\n\n\n\nBe alone: We’re sure you love your friends or family members, but since you’re working solo — the photo should be just you.\n\n\n\nDon’t hide: Keep your sunglasses and hoodie off! If you’re wearing a hat or wrap, be sure it isn’t covering your face.\n\n .        \n\nBe appropriate and professional: Be sure not to include any offensive body language or text in your photo. Likewise, it’s best to avoid photos highlighting unprofessional activities.\n\n\n\nNo cartoonish filters: While we appreciate art, we ask that you refrain from adding cartoon-like filters to your photo.\n\n\n\nDon’t advertise: At Sittercity, we appreciate our users who run various businesses. However, we do not allow advertising of other services on our site.

From our experience, the following messages nearly always lead to a scam:\n\n“I’m overseas, but will be moving to your area soon.”\n“I’d like to pay you in advance to hold the job.”\n“Please send your address so I can send a check.”\n“My finance manager will handle payment and other expenses.”\n“If this employment opportunity is pleasing to you…”\n\nBelow are more tips on how to protect yourself, your money, and your safety.\n \nOnly communicate with parents through Sittercity\nNever give your personal email or cell phone number to someone you’ve just connected with on Sittercity. Plus, when you send and receive messages through our system, you have the added bonus of our software, which flags messages with language and signs associated with common scams.\nNever accept money from someone you’ve never met\nSeem fishy that someone in the UK wants to send you an enormous check for a month’s worth of babysitting, long before you even start the job? More than likely, it’s because a scammer is on the other end of the message. If a care seeker offers to pay you upfront, that’s a red flag.\nUnfortunately, these scammers know you’re looking for a job and could use the money, which is why this scam is so common — and why we see many sitters cash these fake checks and get into sticky situations. Here’s a general rule of thumb (that consequently applies to most things in life): if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. No one would pay you for work you haven’t done yet — these are fraudulent checks.\nNever send money to someone you’ve never met\nIf someone wants to send you a big wad of cash for nothing, what harm could that do? The answer: a lot. You could get into trouble because part two of this scam is when the person asks for some or all of their money back. They may claim to have “accidentally overpaid” you and need you to wire a portion of the payment back to them.\nDo not wire them money to compensate for what they overpaid. This is a scam and unfortunately banks have and will continue to accidentally cash fraudulent checks. Once your bank realizes the check is fake, you may have already sent money to the scammer — and now you’re out of your hard-earned cash.\nDon’t release your background check to just anyone\nBackground checks contain extremely sensitive, scam-friendly  information. If a Sittercity user you’ve never spoken with requests your background check, do not release it. If you’ve never even communicated with this member, there’s no reason they need to see your background check.\nKnow what a scam looks like\nMany scammers can be easily spotted based on their poor grasp of language or lack of clarity. If a job posting or communication with another Sittercity member makes you feel uncomfortable, it’s best to err on the side of safety and move on. Here’s what to watch out for:\n\nMisspellings: Sure, we all make mistakes and might have a typo here or there, but an entire email laden with typos is a bad sign.\nGrammatical errors: Again, one or two here or there is fine. But if the email is full of grammatical errors, the person on the other end may be a scammer.\nForeigners claiming to be coming to the U.S. on special assignment: This is a common start to scam emails. Scammers use this story to rationalize the fake check scam detailed above. While it could be possible that an overseas family is starting their search for a sitter or nanny before they arrive, be extra careful when applying to these jobs.\nInconsistencies: If the care seeker starts off the email as a proud parent of a young toddler boy, but ends the email with a five year old daughter, it’s from a scammer who has hurriedly sent several fake messages without getting their story straight. Parents don’t make those types of mistakes about their own children!\nAdvertisements: A work-from-home job guaranteed to make you $100 an hour? While that certainly seems like it would be nice, move on. This job posting doesn’t belong on Sittercity, where we connect families and caregivers.\n\nIf you do suspect you've encountered a job posting that's a scam, please report it.\n \nPlease be sure to check out our Trust & Safety Center for additional important information regarding trust & safety on Sittercity."

                        "h4":"Our policy for daycare centers depends on whether the center is registering as a business recruiting sitters, or as a sitter seeking child care opportunities.\nDaycare centers recruiting sitters to work for them can register on Sittercity. As this is a specialized subscription, the center should reach out to us here to get started.\nDaycare centers registering as a sitter to seek childcare opportunities are only allowed on Sittercity if they’re single-employee in-home centers. Out-of-home or multi-employee daycare centers are not allowed to seek childcare opportunities on Sittercity. This policy is in place because we run identity authentication on each Sittercity caregiver, and we are unable to authenticate more than one person per account.\nIt’s important to note that we do not verify daycare certification or licensing claims. We recommend verifying those claims directly with the sitter.\nPlease be sure to check out our Trust & Safety Center for additional important information regarding trust & safety on Sittercity."

Keep in mind, if any major offense was uncovered on your driving record, you would be removed from the site.\nBeing 'ineligible' to receive the badge on your profile doesn't mean you won't be able to apply for jobs using Sittercity. This is simply how our badge system works -- if any records are found, a notification is shown for three months instead of a badge. You can see an explanation of each check and what badges you can receive here.\nIf a result is returned on your background check that you do not believe is correct, you may try to contact the County or DMV in which the infraction occurred to inquire about it. If the County or DMV reports that the record is not correct (it shouldn't have been reported), or if you are able to get this infraction completely removed or expunged, you may file a dispute with Sterling Talent Solutions, the background check vendor that processes all background checks done through Sittercity. Disputes can be filed as instructed on your pre-adverse action letter from Sterling.\n \nPlease be sure to check out our Trust & Safety Center for additional important information regarding trust & safety on Sittercity."
