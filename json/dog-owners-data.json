                        "data":"Adequate Equipment  \n As a pet parent, it’s your responsibility to provide adequate equipment for your pet caregiver before the service begins. Before each scheduled service, check to make sure that you have provided the supplies your pet caregiver will need.  For example, if you’ve booked a walk, ensure you’ve left a leash, harness and bags in plain sight for your walker to find. If you’ve booked an in-home service like a Boarding or Pet Day Care, ensure you’ve provided your dog’s bowls, food or other supplies necessary for a safe and successful service.   \n If you’ve booked a Boarding or Pet Day Care service with a transportation component, it’s important that your pet caregiver knows how to safely and securely transport your dog from your home to theirs, and back! It's the responsibility of the pet parent to provide adequate equipment for a safe and smooth transport.  This can include a dog seat belt or harness and/or crate. Crates are a good option to help ensure the pup’s safety when traveling, especially in a car. If you already use a crate, be sure the crate is the right size for the dog being transported and that it can fit in most vehicles. Also, note that crates should be securely anchored to the vehicle.  Since this can be done in a variety of ways, be sure you choose the correct option for both the dog and crate being used.   \nHome Access \n In order to get things off to a successful start, the pet caregiver needs smooth access to the home to pick up the dog. As a pet parent, be sure to provide information about accessing your home within the Wag! app or on our website.   \n We highly encourage pet parents to change lockbox codes often and not to share personal information, including phone numbers, with Pet Care Providers. When changing your lockbox code, don’t forget to update this information within the Wag! app so upcoming pet caregivers have the information they need.  \nCommunication \n The Wag! app is the best channel for communication between you and your pet caregiver. We encourage pet parents to communicate and engage with pet caregivers solely through the Wag! app or our website.  \n Remember that pet caregivers may have questions and direct communication through the app keeps everyone informed. Timely communication is also important for a successful service. Try to respond to pet caregivers as soon as possible, especially if questions arise during a service. We encourage pet parents to keep their mobile devices close during a walk or boarding or sitting engagement. The Wag! app has user safety features that allow you to communicate with pet caregivers safely and conveniently. Use it!   \nDog’s Information \n As a best practice, confirm that your dog's profile is filled out adequately, updated as needed, and includes any special details you may want to convey to your pet caregiver.  \nTimeliness \n If you’re dropping off your dog for a Boarding or Day Care service, be respectful of the agreement you've made with the boarding host and arrive on time.  \nCancellations \n In the event of a last-minute change to their plans or schedule, pet parents have the option to cancel a Wag! scheduled service. Last-minute cancellations can have a negative impact on our community by disrupting schedules and experiences of both pet parents and pet caregivers. Please be mindful of this and keep last-minute cancellations to a minimum. "

I don’t want to use this Pet Caregiver again.   \n 1 Star: Horrible experience; Multiple things went wrong or there was a single significant failure in delivering the service.  \n For a 5- or 4-star rating, you'll be prompted to add the Pet Caregiver to your Preferred Walkers list (click the \"heart\" icon). You may also choose to award the Pet Caregiver a badge and/or leave a tip!

                        "data":"What is pre-authorization? \n When a service has been requested and/or a Pet Caregiver is being assigned to your requested service, Wag! will make a pre-authorization hold to the card on file, for an amount equal to the cost of the service being booked.   \n NOTE: A pre-authorization will appear as a pending charge on your bank account and will only be submitted as a charge upon completion of the service. You may even receive an alert from your financial institution for the hold, but no formal charge will occur until the service is completed by the caregiver.   \nWhen does Wag! pre-authorize a transaction? \n Wag! will pre-authorize any transaction being paid with a credit card. Transactions paid in full with Apple Pay or with Wag! credits will not be subject to preauthorization. For overnight services (including Sitting & Boarding), pre-authorization will occur when the service is booked. For all other services, pre-authorization will occur when a Pet Caregiver has opted-in to the service.  \nWhat if I cancel the service? \n If you should cancel the service, the pre-authorization will be immediately removed. Note that cancelled services may be subject to a cancellation fee.   \nHow much is the pre-authorization? \n The pre-authorization will equal the total cost of the service being booked, including applicable booking fees. If you have any credits on your account, the pre-authorization amount will be the cost of the service minus any redeemable credits.  \n Note: If you have enough credits on your account to cover the entire cost of the service, your card on file will not be pre-authorized.  \nHow will pre-authorization appear on my credit or billing statement? \n Pre-authorization will appear as a pending transaction on your bank statement. Your bank may alert you of a charge to your account, however, this represents the pre-authorization hold, not a charge. The hold will only be submitted as a charge upon completion of the service.  \nWhen can I expect a hold to appear and when will it disappear? \n For Overnight Services (Boardings and Sittings)  \n \n A pre-authorization hold will occur the same day the service is requested.  \n The hold will remain on the account until the service is completed and the account is successfully charged. \n Once a charge is successful, the hold should automatically disappear within 24 hrs, but may take longer depending on your financial institution processing times.  \n If the service cancels, the hold will automatically be removed and should reflect immediately in the account but may take longer depending on your financial institution (NOTE: Services cancelled may be subject to a cancellation fee). \n \n For All Other Services (Walks, Drop-ins, Trainings, Wag! Health)  \n \n A pre-authorization hold will occur when a Pet Caregiver has opted-in to the service. \n If you have an active recurring schedule, pre-authorizations will typically occur within 48hrs of the start time of the walk or when the caregiver is assigned to the walk.  \n Once a charge is successful, the hold should automatically disappear within 24 hrs, but may take longer depending on your financial institution processing times.  \n If the service cancels, the hold will automatically be removed and should reflect immediately in the account but may take longer depending on your financial institution (NOTE: Services cancelled may be subject to a cancellation fee). \n \nWhy does Wag! pre-authorize transactions? \n As of April 1, 2020, preauthorization is required to verify that sufficient funds are available to cover the cost of the service.  \nWhy do I have two charges for the same transaction? \n One of these “charges” is a pre-authorization. The pre-authorization will fall off within 24 hours. If you’re still noticing a pre-authorization on your account after 24 hours, please contact your banking institution.  \nWhat will happen if a pre-authorization fails? \n If Wag! is unable to successfully pre-authorize the card on file, you will receive a notification that the service could not be approved.

Dynamic Pricing is the ability for Pet Caregivers to set their own rates for services and “extras” such as the additional dog and weekly walk surcharges.   \nCan I set my own rates? \n Yes, Dynamic Pricing will allow you, as an independent business owner, to set your own rates for services completed through the Wag! platform. Pet Caregivers are able to set their own pricing for:  \n \n 20, 30, and 60 minute Walks \n Overnight Care (per night) \n Additional dog fees \n Weekly Walk surcharges \n Drop-Ins \n Digital & In-Home Training sessions \n \nHow do I set my own rates? \n You can update your rates or \"Service Pricing\" at any time by tapping “Change Bid” in the Walk Details of an available service. From here, you can adjust your pricing to whatever you believe is fair. You can also adjust your pricing at any time; any adjustments you make will not affect services that you have already booked with a Pet Parent. If you increase a rate after booking a service, you will still receive your initial bid as the service payout, not the new rate.  \nHow do I bid on a service? \n You can change your “bid” or pricing at any time before opting into a service. Once you submit your bid by opting into the service, the pricing for that service cannot be changed. After you request a service, no further action is required. If you are matched to the Pet Parent, you will be notified and the service will appear on your “Booked” tab.   \nAm I setting the payout amount or the cost of the service? \n When you set your rates in the app, you are setting your desired payout for the service. You will see what the Pet Parent will pay for that service directly below your set rates.  \nCan Pet Parents still tip? \n Yes, Pet Parents are still able and encouraged to tip. The tip percentage is calculated from the total cost to the Pet Parent.  \nWhat does “Average price in my area” mean? \n The “Average Price” is the cumulative average price that other Pet Caregivers in your area are charging for the same service type. The “Average Price” is only a suggestion; you are free to set your rates how you wish. Please note that out-of-range pricing may affect Pet Parents’ demand for your services.  \nWhat is a “Weekly Walk Surcharge?” \n The Weekly Walk Surcharge is the additional payout you will receive per service on a Recurring Schedule.

Visit the \"Past Services\" tab in the app to rebook with your favorite pet caregivers.  \nHow do I access the Digital Training session? \n You will access your Digital Training through the Wag! App via a video chat room.   \nWhat if I log into my Digital Training later than the scheduled time? \n We highly recommend communicating with your trainer through the app prior to your Digital Training session to coordinate an exact time you are both available to start. Once the trainer starts the video chat, the time clock cannot be reset.   \nWhen does my 30 minutes start? \n The clock starts as soon as the trainer enters the video chat. A timer will be displayed on screen during the training session.   \nWhat happens if my Digital Training goes over the 30 minute limit? \n The video chat session will automatically disconnect at the 35-minute mark.  \nWhat if me or my trainer has technical issues and gets disconnected during the session? \n Once the timer starts, it cannot be reset or paused.  You may rejoin the video chat session if you were disconnected and pick up where you left off. If you or your trainer have a prolonged disconnect that severely impacted your Digital Training session, please contact Customer Service via the help tab in the app.   \nWhat happens during a Digital Training session? \n The sky's the limit! What happens and what is covered during a Digital Training session is up to you and your trainer.   \nDo I have to bring anything to my Digital Training session?  \n We recommend having items ready on hand based on your training needs. For instance, if your concern is leash training, have your leash nearby. It's also helpful to know what motivates your pup; you might consider keeping some treats or their favorite toy handy during your session as motivation or rewards.  \nWhen will I be charged for my Digital Training service? \n Your session will be charged to your preferred payment method once the service ends.  \nCan I leave a tip for my trainer? \n Absolutely! Once the Digital Training session has ended you will have an opportunity to leave a tip for your trainer through the app.  \nDo I receive a report card like I do with other services? \n Yes, your trainer will leave you a report card that may include follow up notes, reminders, tips, or homework for you and your dog(s).  \nI live in a remote area, can I still purchase Digital Training sessions? \n Yes, Digital Training sessions are available to all Pet Parents on the platform.  \nDo I need to allow permissions on my device? \n Yes, you  will need to allow the app the following permissions:  \n \n Camera \n Microphone \n External Storage \n"

If you are booking with a past or preferred Pet Caregiver, their rates can be found on their public profile, which you can view under the \"Past Caregivers\" tab on the Wag! app. If you're new to the platform, rates will be displayed at the bottom of the screen during booking.  \nWhat is Dynamic Pricing? \n To best support the Pet Caregivers using Wag!, we’ve created the Dynamic Pricing feature, which allows Pet Caregivers to set their own rates as business owners. Dynamic Pricing is the ability for Pet Caregivers to set their own rates for services and “extras” such as the additional dog and weekly walk surcharges.   \nIs my tip separate from the listed price? \n Yes, you still have the option to tip on all Wag! Services. A tip is not included in the listed price.  \nWhy is the cost of services different every time? \n You will not be charged outside the range listed in the app, but the price may vary within that range. Pet Caregivers are free to update their pricing at any time, effective for all future services. Once a schedule has been booked, they cannot change the rate for that individual service.   \nWhat is a Booking Fee? \n Wag! charges a booking fee of $1.99 for each schedule booked. Note that you will only be charged one booking fee if you book a recurring or multi-day schedule. There is no booking fee for Wag! Premium members.  \nCan I book multiple services at the same rate with the same Pet Caregiver? \n Yes. You can book a multi-day, one-time schedule, or a recurring schedule with the same Pet Caregiver. For multi-day and single Pet Caregiver recurring services, the rate will be the same for each service on the schedule.  \nDo I pay the same if my Pet Caregiver I selected submits a cover/cancels? \n If your Pet Caregiver submits a cover, Wag! will search for another Pet Caregiver near you to complete the service as originally scheduled. You will pay the same amount for the service.  \nCan a Pet Caregiver change their pricing after I accept their bid? \n No, Pet Caregivers are unable to change their price bid once you have confirmed the service.

As we all continue to monitor the situation very closely, we wanted to share that Pet Caregivers continue to be available for walking, sitting, boarding, and training on the Wag! platform. The health and safety for Pet Caregivers, Pet Parents, and their dogs are and always will be our highest priority. In situations such as this, we understand that we need to evolve the Wag! platform to help do our part to best serve the community as safely as possible.   \n Below you’ll find information on recent platform changes, including Socially Distanced Services, the dedicated COVID-19 Tip function, and our COVID-19 Resource Center and FAQs. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as they become available.  \n  \n Socially Distanced Services  \n Pet Parents may update their Home Access notes to request a service as a socially distanced service and to provide specific instructions to help limit physical interactions. Here is an example of simple measures you can take when performing socially distanced services:  \n \n Requesting a “socially distanced service” -- When requesting a walk through the Wag! platform, pet parents can update the \"How to get in\" section with the socially distanced service request and any relevant instructions to help limit interaction. For example: \"Socially Distanced Service - I’ll have Fido ready with a harness and leash on. Please knock or message me in-app when you arrive and I’ll open the front door and hand the attached leash to you.\" \n Preparing your dog -- Put on the dog’s harness and leash in advance of the pick-up and walk. \n Ensuring a smooth handoff -- Pet Parents can message their Pet Caregiver in-app to remind them of the request for a socially distanced service. When the Pet Caregiver arrives, simply hand the leash off. Lastly, remember to wash your hands before handling the leash and after both pick-up and drop-off and follow advice from public health authorities like the CDC. \n \n  \n Dedicated COVID-19 Tip Function  \n To support the Pet Caregiver community in defraying the cost of additional COVID-19 related safety supplies, pet parents now have the option to give a “Dedicated COVID-19 Tip.” This provides a mechanism for a Pet Parent to help pay for gloves, hand sanitizer, as well as any other essential equipment.  \n  \n COVID-19 Resource Center and FAQs  \n For your informational purposes, we have created a COVID-19 Resource Center and Frequently Asked Questions article so you can keep yourself updated on the impact and best practices for you and your pets with the Wag! platform. We’ll continue to update the community on additional solutions and recommendations to help Pet Parents stay safe and healthy during these unique times.  \n  \n We ask that Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers follow the guidance of the CDC and the below tips to help prevent the further spread of the virus:   \n \n If you or a household member feel sick, please help keep Pet Caregivers safe. \n Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds if soap and water are not readily available, clean hands by using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, including immediately before and after a service is completed.  \n When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands.  \n Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick, and please seek medical care if you have a fever and symptoms, such as cough and/or difficulty breathing.  \n \n  \n We are prepared to navigate these challenging circumstances with the Wag! community’s health and safety in mind. Our services will continue, along with 24/7 customer support, and we thank you in advance for working with us to ensure the Wag! platform operates as safely as possible. "
