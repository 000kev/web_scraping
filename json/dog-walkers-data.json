Crates are a good option to help ensure the pup’s safety when traveling, especially when in a car.  If you use a crate, make sure that the crate is the correct size for the dog being transported and that the crate is securely anchored to the vehicle. This can be done in a variety of ways, so be sure you choose the correct option for the dog, and crate being used.  \n For tips specific to driving with a dog, check out these helpful tips from Robert Cabral: Road Trip: Driving With Your Dog "

Once you start the video chat, the time clock cannot be paused or reset.   \nWhen does the 30 minutes start? \n The clock starts as soon as the Trainer enters the video chat. A timer will be displayed on screen during the training session to help keep track of time.   \nWhat happens if the Digital Training goes over the 30 minute limit? \n The video chat session will automatically disconnect at the 35 minute mark.  \nWhat if I or the Pet Parent have technical issues and get disconnected during the session? \n Once the timer starts on the session, it cannot be reset or paused. You may rejoin the video chat session if you are disconnected and pick up where you left off. If you or the Pet Parent have a prolonged disconnect that severely impacts the Digital Training session, please contact Customer Service via the \"Help\" tab in the app.   \nCan Pet Parents leave a tip? \n Absolutely! Once the Digital Training session has ended the Pet Parent will be given the opportunity to leave a tip through the Wag!

This allows trainers to see the pets' normal routines and behaviors in a familiar setting and with familiar people.   \nHow should I start a Training session? \n Because each lesson is unique, Pet Caregivers are encouraged to begin each session with an assessment of the Pet Parent’s needs and desired skills; these are then used to create an individualized plan for improvement using appropriate training methods.  \nShould I send anything to the Pet Parent before a Training session? \n Some Pet Caregivers find it valuable to send Pet Parents materials to review leading up to their Training sessions. Sending videos and photos both during and after the session can also help to mark the progress of both the pet and Pet Parent.  \nCan a Pet Parent rebook me directly for additional Training sessions? \n Yes; after your initial session, Pet Parents are able to book with you directly from the Wag!

                        "data":"What notifications should I expect to receive from Wag!? \n Wag! sends push notifications for services available near you, when you’ve received a tip, and promotions from the Marketing Team. SMS notifications are sent when you’ve booked a service, when you’re late for a service, and as confirmation that a cover has been submitted.   \nHow do available service notifications work?  \n When a schedule is requested by a Pet Parent, the service enters the feed and Wag! sends an initial batch of notifications to Pet Caregivers who are preferred for the service. After a couple minutes, if the schedule is still unfilled, a second batch of notifications is sent to the Pet Caregivers who are closest to the service location (based on the PCG’s Available Service Filter location settings). Next, if the service is still unfilled, an additional batch of notifications is sent to Pet Caregivers in the area, selected based on distance from service. This process continues until the service is filled.  \nWhy are my notifications delayed? \n The Wag! system sends out notifications in real time. However, due to circumstances beyond our control such as carrier issues and signal strength there may be times notifications are delayed in getting to you. Make sure you have good signal strength. Delays in notifications may also occur on a device that is connected to WiFi.   \nWhy am I not receiving push notifications? \n \n You are logged in to more than one device (Note: The most recently logged into device will receive the notifications.) Log out, then back in on the device you’d like to receive notifications on to reset your device token. \n There is low or no service availability in your area. This typically means you will also not see any services in your available service feed, either.  \n Your Walker App notification settings are set to “off.” Update your notification settings on the Available Service Filters screen.  \n Your phone's settings for push notifications are set to “off” or are disabled for the Wag! Walker app. Allow notifications from Wag! Walker in your device settings.  \n \nWhy am I not receiving text notifications?  \n As of January 2020, Wag! has discontinued SMS notifications for available walks and will be exclusively sending push notifications for these alerts. A few other reasons you could no longer be receiving text notifications include:   \n \n Your notification settings are set to “off.”  \n You blocked text notifications. Text the word \"START\" to 240-06 re-enable text messages from Wag!. \n \nHow do I update my notification settings?  \n You can update what services you’d like to receive notifications about in your Available Service Filters, located in the top right corner of the Home screen. From here, you can turn off notifications completely, set your location and the distance from which you’d like to be notified of a service, adjust start times, and select service types.   \nHow do I update or add an address? \n \n Tap on the Available Service Filters icon in the top right corner of the Home screen → \n Tap “Services Near” → \n Tap “+” in the bottom right corner (Android) or “+ Add Location” (iOS) → \n Name the location and enter the address (note: all location names must be unique) → \n Tap \"Save.\" To edit an address, tap the green pencil icon next to the location you wish to edit (Android) / tap “Edit” under the address (iOS). \n \nHow do I turn off push notifications? \n \n Tap on the Available Service Filters icon in the top right corner of the Home screen → \n Set the Notification Alerts toggle to “off” → \n Tap “Save” \n \nHow do I turn off text notifications? \n To opt-out of text message notifications from Wag!, text “STOP” to 240-06. If you’d like to turn text notifications back on, text “START” to 240-06.  \nWhy don’t I see any available services? \n There may not be any services available in your area, or your available service filters may be too narrow. Try expanding your filters, and refreshing the service feed by pulling down on the screen then releasing.  \nWhy am I not being accepted for services? \n If you tap a push notification for an available service and the walk is not featured in your Available Service Feed or you were able to opt-in and were not approved, the service was unfortunately taken by another Pet Caregiver.

A number of factors are applied to determine a Pet Caregiver’s Pet Parent Favorability, all of which can be found within the Wag! Community Guidelines.  \nFor what is Pet Parent Favorability used? \n Pet Parent Favorability is used to find the perfect Pet Caregiver for each pet care task scheduled using the Wag! platform.   \nHow do I increase my Pet Parent Favorability? \n Pet Parents expect services to be completed with care and attention to detail. Your reliability (including timeliness and commitment) also affects the Pet Parent’s experience and therefore your Pet Parent Favorability. The strength of your profile is another factor; the more complete and thorough your profile is, the more valuable your profile will be to Pet Parents looking to book pet care services.   \n The Wag! Community Guidelines are the framework for Pet Parent Favorability and are in place to help facilitate a community-wide understanding of expectations and standards of conduct while using Wag!. Ultimately, following and exemplifying Wag!’s Community Guidelines makes your services more valuable to the Pet Parent’s using Wag!. For additional information as to how Pet Parent Favorability is determined, you may revisit the Wag! Community Guidelines. "

Pet Caregivers who violate the agreement or Wag!’s Community Guidelines may be subject to deactivation. The Deactivation Policy also states that Pet Caregiver accounts may be subject to suspension during the time Wag! takes to investigate a possible violation.  \nCan I appeal a deactivation if my rating falls below 4.75? \n No. Deactivations due to low star rating are not eligible for appeal.  \nWhy does Wag! have a deactivation policy? \n Wag! is dedicated to creating and maintaining a safe community for the Pet Caregivers and Pet Parents on the platform. To help ensure a safe experience for everyone, we rely on each community member to abide by the Wag! Community Guidelines as well as our Pet Care Provider Platform User Agreement. The five star rating system is one of the ways Wag! leverages community feedback to help create and maintain a safe and reliable community.  \nHow can I check my standing to ensure I’m not subject to deactivation? \n You can see your star rating in the “My Profile” section of the Wag! application. Pet caregivers will be notified via email if they are at risk for deactivation due to low star rating. Once a Pet Caregiver receives this notice, they will have 30 days to improve. They will also receive a second update email after 14 days informing them of their progress.  \nWhat if I did not receive a warning email? \n Please check your spam folders and ensure that the email address associated with your Wag! account is still active.  \nWhat if I am not available to do any walks in the 30-day warning period? Can I request an extension? \n Wag! gives all Pet Caregivers 30 days to meet community standards. Pet Caregivers will not be granted an extension if they are unable to or choose not to participate in services with Wag!.  \nHow many times can my star rating drop below 4.75? \n None. Once a Pet Caregiver's star rating falls below 4.75, they are subject to deactivation.  \nIf I'm deactivated, will I still be paid for past completed walks? \n Yes. Any successfully completed services will be paid out, regardless of whether the Pet Care Provider is subject to deactivation or has been deactivated.  \nIf I'm deactivated, can I reapply? \n No. Once a Pet Caregiver is deactivated for falling below the set criteria or is deactivated for a Community Guidelines violation, they will not not be allowed to re-apply as a Pet Caregiver on the Wag! platform.  \nAre Pet Parents subject to these same standards? \n This Deactivation Policy is based on criteria specific to Pet Caregivers. Pet Parents can be deactivated from the Wag! platform if they violate Wag!’s Terms of Service, which includes the Wag! Community Guidelines.  \nWhat if I'm a new Pet Caregiver? \n Pet Caregivers must complete at least ten services on the Wag! platform to be subject to this policy. "

To have your weekly payouts sent to your bank account, you need to have only ONE debit card and ONE bank account set up in Stripe. Pre-paid debit cards are not supported at this time.   \nIs there a fee for Instant Pay? \n The Instant Pay fee is 3% of the eligible payment amount, with a minimum fee of $1.99 and a minimum total payout of more than $1 (your \"total payout\" is the amount earned minus the Instant Pay fee). You will be able to view your “Total Payment” (the amount of money eligible for Instant Pay minus the fee) before requesting to initiate Instant Pay.   \n Note: Payments are reviewed, which may result in delays or funds being frozen or removed from your account. Your standard weekly payment is still available for no fee.   \nAm I eligible to use Instant Pay? \n To be eligible for Instant Pay on the Wag! platform, Pet Caregivers must (1) have been activated on the Wag! platform at least 30 days prior to the payment initiation, (2) completed at least 10 services via the Wag! platform, and (3) have successfully received at least one standard weekly payment through Stripe. Additionally, Pet Caregivers must be in good standing on the Wag! platform (not suspended or deactivated). Instant Pay requests can be initiated for amounts greater than the minimum fee amount ($1.99) to an eligible debit card on the Pet Caregiver's Stripe account.  \nI didn’t see my payment immediately, what should I do? \n When you successfully initiate an Instant Pay transaction, the status “Processing” will be displayed next to the Instant Pay symbol in the \"Payments\" screen on your app. When the transaction is successful, the status will be updated to “Completed.” If it has not been updated to “Completed” within 30 minutes, please be patient, as bank processing times may vary. If the transaction is marked as “Completed,” but you do not see the money appear in your account, please contact your bank.  \n When contacting your bank about a payment sent to your debit card, please note that money will appear as an original credit transaction (OCT), not an ACH or direct deposit.  \n Note: Payments are reviewed, which may result in delays or funds being frozen or removed from your account.  \nWhen can I initiate instant pay? \n Instant payments can be initiated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  \nWhy do standard weekly payments arrive slower than Instant Payments? \n Standard weekly payments are processed using ACH bank processing, which typically takes 1-3 business days to appear in your account. Instant Pay is processed using a debit card, which allows the money to appear in your account more quickly.  \n Note: Payments are reviewed, which may result in delays or funds being frozen or removed from your account.  \nHow do I know if my debit card is eligible for Instant Pay? \n Most debit cards from major banks are supported, and more bank debit cards are being added over time. Please contact Stripe if you have a question about whether your debit card is supported.  \nWhy is the eligible Instant Pay amount different from the displayed standard weekly amount? \n A pay period starts on a Tuesday and ends the following Monday. Earnings accrued during that pay period will be transferred to your bank account on the following Friday (4 days after the pay period ends). Instant Pay can include funds outside of a standard pay period. You will be able to keep track of what services are included in a payment (whether a standard weekly payment or an Instant Payment) via the \"Past Payments\" screen in the Walker App. "

You'll also receive a $20 Referral Award once the Pet Parent has completed their first fully paid service!  \n NOTE: Please be aware that these are third party platforms for which Wag! is not responsible. Third party platforms have their own terms of use, privacy policies and other rules and guidelines, which may change over time and which users should independently review.      \nNextdoor \n Nextdoor is a social platform centered around neighborhood communities. Many users use their platform to recommend and discover local businesses.   \n You can create an account as an individual or as a “Neighbor for hire”. Nextdoor has restrictions on promoting your business with an individual account, so if you choose to join as an individual, make sure to follow their promotion rules listed here.   \n If you choose to create an account as a “Neighbor for hire”, neighbors will be able to easily find you when they search for pet caregiver services. They can also recommend you, which will allow other members to find your Business page in the Nextdoor Businesses section. Information about what you can and cannot post from your Business page can be found here.   \nCraigslist \n For detailed information on how to promote your business on Craigslist, click here.  \n Craigslist is a web-based advertising platform. Users can search for items, services, housing, etc. Individuals may create posts for free with or without an account. Information about posting without an account can be found here.   \n While most Craigslist postings are free, there are a few scenarios in which you may be asked to pay a fee.  \nGoogle My Business \n Google My Business is an accessible business promotion tool which allows users to promote their website/business on Google Search and Google Maps.   \n When users create a Business profile, they can link directly to their online Wag! profile. Business profiles also give users an online presence so that potential clients can search for their business on Google. More information can be found here.  \nGoogle Ads \n While Google My Business is an accessible platform that allows users to list their business on Maps and Google Search, Google Ads is a paid advertising platform that can attract more visitors and new clients to their Google My Business website or public Wag! profile.   \n Google Ads can display your ad when people search online for services like dog walking, sitting and boarding. Generally you will only pay when users engage with your ad.   \n Information about advertising with Google can be found here.   \nOther Promotional Materials \n Many Pet Caregivers create and personalize printable flyers that they post around their neighborhood. They also post unprinted, PDF versions of their flyer online.   \n By navigating to your profile, and then tapping “Promote,” “Promotional Materials,” and “Download Flyers,” Pet Caregivers can choose to get an email with a PDF of a sample flyer. Feel free to personalize the flyer however you like to promote your own business! "

Anyone with your profile link will be able to view your profile online even if they aren’t currently on the Wag! platform.   \nI don’t want my profile to be public. How do I make it private?  \n You can make your profile “private” at any time. Open your walker app and navigate to “settings”, then toggle the “public profile” setting to “off”. Keep in mind that if your profile is private, Pet Parents will not be able to book you directly through your profile for a referral bonus, and you won’t have the ability to share your profile online.   \nWhat is a catchphrase? \n Your personal catchphrase is an option for you to briefly introduce who you are as a Pet Caregiver and adds a personal touch to your profile. It’s one of the first things Pet Parents will see when viewing your profile. Catchphrases have a 50 character minimum.   \nWhy were my profile edits rejected? \n Our automatic filters have detected one of the following types of content that either include profanity or your personal information:   \n \n Profane language \n Email address \n Phone number \n Website  \n Social media reference \n \n If you think your profile edits were rejected in error, please contact customer success. Please adhere to our community guidelines (https://wagwalking.com/community-guidelines/).  \nWhy is my catchphrase/bio “pending”? \n If your catchphrase/bio is marked as “pending”, our automatic filters may have detected potential profanity or personal information such as your phone number or email address. If you think there is an error, please contact customer success. Please adhere to our community guidelines (https://wagwalking.com/community-guidelines/).  \nI’m an Android user and I am not able to update my profile. What should I do? \n If you are getting an error when updating your profile, it may be due to a system font conflict.   \n To update the font:  \n \n Navigate to your phone's Settings → \n Tap \"Display\" → \n Tap \"Font Size and Style\" → \n Adjust font size to \"default\" (third dot from the left) \n \n Once complete, try updating your profile again.  \nI referred a pet parent through my profile. Why didn’t I receive a referral bonus? \n In order to receive a referral bonus, the Pet Parent must sign up through your profile and complete their first paid walk.   \n If they have completed a paid walk and you still haven’t received the bonus, please reach out to our customer success team for support.  \nA Pet Parent booked me through my profile. Why did they match with a different walker? \n When a Pet Parent books you through your profile, you will be added to their preferred walker list. This gives you, and other preferred walkers for that Pet Parent, first priority for services where the pet parent specifies “try preferred” as their walker preference.  \n The most likely reason you did not match with the Pet Parent is another pet caregiver requested for the walk before you.   \nHow can I promote my profile online?  \n If you’d like to promote your profile online, you can copy your profile link from within the walker app. Click “promote”, then “copy link to my profile”. You can post your link online, or you can send it directly to friends via SMS, email, and more!

                        "data":"What notifications should I expect to receive from Wag!? \n Wag! sends push notifications for services available near you, when you’ve received a tip, and promotions from the Marketing Team. SMS notifications are sent when you’ve booked a service, when you’re late for a service, and as confirmation that a cover has been submitted.   \nHow do available service notifications work?  \n When a schedule is requested by a Pet Parent, the service enters the feed and Wag! sends an initial batch of notifications to Pet Caregivers who are preferred for the service. After a couple minutes, if the schedule is still unfilled, a second batch of notifications is sent to the Pet Caregivers who are closest to the service location (based on the PCG’s Available Service Filter location settings). Next, if the service is still unfilled, an additional batch of notifications is sent to Pet Caregivers in the area, selected based on distance from service. This process continues until the service is filled.  \nWhy are my notifications delayed? \n The Wag! system sends out notifications in real time. However, due to circumstances beyond our control such as carrier issues and signal strength there may be times notifications are delayed in getting to you. Make sure you have good signal strength. Delays in notifications may also occur on a device that is connected to WiFi.   \nWhy am I not receiving push notifications? \n \n You are logged in to more than one device (Note: The most recently logged into device will receive the notifications.) Log out, then back in on the device you’d like to receive notifications on to reset your device token. \n There is low or no service availability in your area. This typically means you will also not see any services in your available service feed, either.  \n Your Walker App notification settings are set to “off.” Update your notification settings on the Available Service Filters screen.  \n Your phone's settings for push notifications are set to “off” or are disabled for the Wag! Walker app. Allow notifications from Wag! Walker in your device settings.  \n \nWhy am I not receiving text notifications?  \n As of January 2020, Wag! has discontinued SMS notifications for available walks and will be exclusively sending push notifications for these alerts. A few other reasons you could no longer be receiving text notifications include:   \n \n Your notification settings are set to “off.”  \n You blocked text notifications. Text the word \"START\" to 240-06 re-enable text messages from Wag!. \n \nHow do I update my notification settings?  \n You can update what services you’d like to receive notifications about in your Available Service Filters, located in the top right corner of the Home screen. From here, you can turn off notifications completely, set your location and the distance from which you’d like to be notified of a service, adjust start times, and select service types.   \nHow do I update or add an address? \n \n Tap on the Available Service Filters icon in the top right corner of the Home screen → \n Tap “Services Near” → \n Tap “+” in the bottom right corner (Android) or “+ Add Location” (iOS) → \n Name the location and enter the address (note: all location names must be unique) → \n Tap \"Save.\" To edit an address, tap the green pencil icon next to the location you wish to edit (Android) / tap “Edit” under the address (iOS). \n \nHow do I turn off push notifications? \n \n Tap on the Available Service Filters icon in the top right corner of the Home screen → \n Set the Notification Alerts toggle to “off” → \n Tap “Save” \n \nHow do I turn off text notifications? \n To opt-out of text message notifications from Wag!, text “STOP” to 240-06. If you’d like to turn text notifications back on, text “START” to 240-06.  \nWhy don’t I see any available services? \n There may not be any services available in your area, or your available service filters may be too narrow. Try expanding your filters, and refreshing the service feed by pulling down on the screen then releasing.  \nWhy am I not being accepted for services? \n If you tap a push notification for an available service and the walk is not featured in your Available Service Feed or you were able to opt-in and were not approved, the service was unfortunately taken by another Pet Caregiver.

                        "data":" We know the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") is on many of our minds. As we all continue to monitor the situation very closely, we wanted to share that Pet Caregivers continue to be available for walking, sitting and boarding on the Wag! platform. The health and safety for Pet Caregivers, Pet Parents and their dogs are and always will be our highest priority. In situations such as this, we understand that we need to evolve the Wag! platform to help do our part to best serve you and the community as safely as possible.   \n Below you’ll find information on recent platform changes, including Socially Distanced Services, dedicated COVID-19 Tip Function, and our COVID-19 Resource Center and FAQs. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as they become available.  \n  \n Socially Distanced Services  \n Pet Parents may update “How to get in” to request a service as a socially distanced service and to provide specific instructions to help limit physical interactions. Here is an example of simple measures you can take when performing socially distanced services:  \n \n Requesting a “socially distanced service” - When requesting a walk through the Wag! platform, Pet Parents have the option to update the \"How to get in\" section with the socially distanced service request and any relevant instructions to help limit interaction. For example: \"Socially Distanced Service - I’ll have Fido ready with a harness and leash on. Please knock or message me in-app when you arrive and I’ll open the front door and hand the attached leash to you.\" \n Pet Parents can message their Pet Caregiver in-app to remind them of the request for a socially distanced service. Remember to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before handling the leash and after both pick-up and drop-off and follow advice from public health authorities like the CDC. \n \n  \n Dedicated COVID-19 Tip Function  \n To support the Pet Caregiver community in defraying the cost of additional COVID-19 related safety supplies, Pet Parents now have the option to give a “Dedicated COVID-19 Tip.” This provides a mechanism for a Pet Parent to help pay for gloves, hand sanitizer, as well as any other essential equipment.  \n  \n COVID-19 Resources  \n We ask that Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers follow the guidance of the CDC and the below tips to help prevent the further spread of the virus:   \n \n If you feel sick, please stay home; don’t request services on the platform.  \n Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds if soap and water are not readily available, clean hands by using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, including immediately before and after a service is completed.  \n When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands.  \n Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick, and please seek medical care if you have a fever and symptoms, such as cough and/or difficulty breathing.  \n \nWhat do I do if there are no available walks in my area?  \n For safety, cities and states across the country continue to adjust travel and quarantine restrictions due to COVID-19. If your area is still affected by a reduced number of Pet Parent requests, Wag! recommends using your public profile to promote your services and to remind local Pet Parents that Wag! is still here to help by providing socially distanced services. For details on how to update and self promote your Wag! Caregiver Profile click on this link.  \nFurther Support \n Wag! has partnered with Stride to provide Pet Caregivers with health and financial resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. For more information on Stride and its benefits, please click this link.  \n  \n We are prepared to navigate these challenging circumstances with the Wag! community’s health and safety in mind. Our services will continue, along with 24/7 customer support, and we thank you in advance for working with us to ensure the Wag! platform operates as safely as possible.  "

Services are booked by Pet Parents, the health and safety of the Wag! community is our top priority.   \n With this in mind, we have launched an optional informational session for Pet Caregivers to learn about CDC recommendations in the context of pet care & dog walking. Most Pet Caregivers finish the session in under 5 minutes, and upon completion, the following 'Socially Distanced Pet Care' tag will be awarded to you and displayed on your profile:   \n    \n IMPORTANT: When accessing the course, please enter the email address associated with your Wag! Walking account, or else we may not be able to display the tag on your profile automatically.   \n \n Frequently Asked Questions  \n \n I never got an email about this. Can I still complete the session?  Yes! You can complete the session by visiting this link.  When entering your information on the course page, please use the email address associated with your Wag! Walking account. If you use a different email, we will not be able to display the tag on your profile.  \n How can I get the Socially Distanced Pet Care tag on my profile?  As soon as you complete the informational session, the 'Socially Distanced Pet Care' tag will appear on your profile. Please allow up to 24 hours for the tag to appear, but in most cases, the tag will appear instantly.  \n I completed the session over 24 hours ago and I still haven't gotten the tag.   We're sorry to hear that! The most common cause of this issue is completing the course under an email address that is different from the email on file for your Wag! Walking account.    Please reach out to support under the 'Help' tab of the Wag! Walking app if the issue persists, and after verifying that you have fully completed the course we can manually add the tag to your profile.    \n \n Thank you for working with us to ensure the Wag! platform operates as safely as possible!  "

Here are some of the best practices to follow when creating a password:   \n \n Straight rows of keys are easy to guess.  \n Short keyboard patterns are easy to guess.  \n Use a longer keyboard pattern with more turns.  \n Repeats like \"aaa\" are easy to guess.  \n Sequences like \"abc\" or \"6543\" are easy to guess. \n Repeats like \"abcabcabc\" are only slight harder to guess than \"abc\".  \n Avoid dates and years that are associated with you.  \n Avoid recent years.  \n Capitalization does not help very much.  \n Reversed words aren't much harder to guess.  \n All uppercase is almost as easy to guess as all lower case.  \n Avoid predictable substitutions like \"@\" instead of at.  \n \n In addition to the above tips, we recommend your password includes:  \n \n More than eight characters \n Both upper- and lower-case letters \n A mix of numbers and special characters (i.e., # @ $ % &) \n \nI can't change my password! \n If you can't update your password or are receiving an \"Invalid Input\" error message, please follow the Strong Password guidelines above (or click here).  "
